1 - IntroductionRich Context Introductory ChapterIan Mulvany, Paco Nathan, Sophie Rand, Julia LaneThe social sciences are at a crossroads. The enormous growth of thescientific enterprise, coupled with rapid technological progress, hascreated opportunities to conduct research at a scale that would havebeen almost unimaginable a generation or two ago. The rise of cheapcomputing, connected mobile devices, and social networks with globalreach allows researchers to rapidly acquire massive, rich datasets; toroutinely fit statistical models that would once have seemed intractablycomplex; and to probe the way that people think, feel, behave, andinteract with one another in ever more naturalistic, fine-grained ways.Yet much of the core infrastructure is manual and ad-hoc in nature,threatening the legitimacy and utility of social science research.We can and must do better. The great challenges of our time are human innature - terrorism, climate change, the use of natural resources, andthe nature of work - and require robust social science to understand thesources and consequences. Yet the lack of reproducibility andreplicability evident in many fields(<em>1</em>–<em>5</em>) is even more acute in thestudy of human behavior both because of the difficulty of sharingconfidential data and because of the lack of scientific infrastructure.There is an enormous interest, while only a fraction of datasets areidentified in scientific research, those publications that do cite dataare cited up to 25% more than those that do not(<em>6</em>)The central argument we advance in this monograph is that advances intechnology—and particularly, in automation—can now change the way inwhich social science is done. Social scientists have eagerly adopted newtechnologies in virtually every area of social science research—fromliterature searches to data storage to statistical analysis todissemination of results.A major challenge is search and discovery. The vast majority of socialscience data and outputs cannot be easily discovered by otherresearchers even when nominally deposited in the public domain. A newgeneration of automated search tools could help researchers discover howdata are being used, in what research fields, with what methods, withwhat code and with what findings. And automation can be used to rewardresearchers who validate the results and contribute additionalinformation about use, fields, methods, code, and findings.(<em>7</em>)Vannevar Bush foreshadowed the issue more than 60 years ago:&gt; “There is a growing mountain of research. But there is increased&gt; evidence that we are being bogged down today as specialization&gt; extends. The investigator is staggered by the findings and conclusions&gt; of thousands of other workers—conclusions which he cannot find time&gt; to grasp, much less to remember, as they appear. … Mendel’s concept&gt; of the laws of genetics was lost to the world for a generation because&gt; his publication did not reach the few who were capable of grasping and&gt; extending it; and this sort of catastrophe is undoubtedly being&gt; repeated all about us, as truly significant attainments become lost in&gt; the mass of the inconsequential”(<em>8</em>).This challenge is particularly true for empirical research. Faced with anever-ending stream of new findings and datasets generated usingdifferent code and analytical techniques, researchers cannot readilydetermine who has worked in an area before, what methods were used, whatwas produced, and where those products can be found. Resolving suchuncertainties consumes an enormous amount of time and energy for manysocial scientists. Automated tools and services could greatly facilitatethe process—often by passively capitalizing on the accumulated laborof one’s extended research community.In sum, the use of data depends critically on knowing how it has beenproduced and used before: the required elements what do the data<strong><em>measure</em></strong>, what <strong><em>research</em></strong> has been done by what<strong><em>researchers,</em></strong> with what <strong><em>code</em></strong>, and with what <strong><em>results</em></strong>.Acquiring that knowledge has historically been manual and inadequate.The challenge is particularly acute in the case of confidential data onhuman subjects, since it is impossible to provide fully open access tothe source files.Although a field is developing to generate automated approaches, thereare five major scientific challenges: (i) document corpus development,(ii) ontology development for dataset entity classification, (iii)natural language processing and machine learning models for datasetentity extraction, (iv) graph models for improving search and discovery,and (v) the use of the results to engage the community to both validatethe model results, retrain the model and to contribute code andknowledge.Section 1 provides an overview of the motivation and approach. Section 2describes new approaches to develop corpora and ontologies. Section 3describes the competition results in terms of model development. Section4 provides a forward looking agenda.Section 1: Motivation and approachIn Chapter 2, " Where’s Waldo: Conceptual issues when characterizingdata in empirical research," researchers from the Research Data andService Center at the Deutsche Bundesbank show us why better metadatafor social science data enables discovery of datasets and research, inways that surpass what traditional metadata from data producers cansupport. They present a new modus operandi in the service delivery modelof research data facilities, based on the premise that datasets have ameasurable value that can be deduced from the relationships betweendatasets and publications, and the people who author, do research on,and consume them - that is, Rich Context around datasets.They argue that a major advantage of rich context is that it closes theloop on metadata is closed: a loop initiated by the metadata from thedata producer side, is closed by metadata from the data usage side. Theauthors elucidate why such rich data from the <em>usage</em> perspective isneeded to deliver codified knowledge to the research community to guideliterature review and new research; without understanding the linkagebetween datasets and outcomes, we are disabled in shaping new, impactfulresearch.  The authors identify two primary reasons for this need: first, thatmetadata on the datasets from the data users perspective helps the datacreator to improve upon the quality of the data itself, improvingdataset owners’ service delivery (e.g. bundesbank as a service provider,the service being data provision, consulting on dataset usage, creationof new data products, etc); and second, that metadata on the usage ofdatasets in publications helps us measure impact of datasets in theirability to drive policy-making. With this closed loop, the scope ofresearchers’ discovery is broadened to include not only literature anddatasets, but the interplay between those two - that is, how datasetshave been used by whom and how.   The authors discuss a tangible outcomeof measuring dataset value - a dataset recommendation system, enablingexpedient sharing of available datasets through the research community.Chapter 3 outlines the operational approach that was taken to developthe <a href="https://coleridgeinitiative.org/richcontextcompetition">Rich ContextCompetition</a>.The goal of the competition, the results of which are described inSection 2, was to implement AI to automatically extract metadata fromresearch - identifying datasets in publications, authors and experts,and methodologies used. As such, the competition was designed to engagepractitioners in AI and NLP to develop models based on a corpusdeveloped at the Interuniversity Consortium of Political and SocialResearch. The competition attracted 20 teams from around the world andresulted in four finalists presenting their results at NYU on February15, 2019 (see the <a href="https://coleridgeinitiative.org/richcontextcompetition/workshopagenda">agenda and videohere</a>).The results of the competition provided metadata to describe links amongdatasets used in social science research. In other words, the outcome ofthe competition generated the basis for a moderately-sized knowledgegraph. the <a href="https://ocean.sagepub.com/blog/an-interview-with-the-allen-institute-for-artificial-intelligence">winningteam</a>in the Rich Context Competition was from <a href="https://allenai.org/">AllenAI</a> which is a leader in the field of usingembedded models for natural language. Typical open source frameworkswhich are popular for deep learning research include<a href="https://pytorch.org/">PyTorch</a> (from Facebook) and the more recent<a href="https://ray.readthedocs.io/en/latest/distributed_training.html">Ray</a>(from UC Berkeley RISElab).Section 2:===========A major challenge is developing a training corpus that sufficientlyrepresents the population of all documents, and tagging the datasets inthe corpus. It is essential to do this well if high quality models areto be developed. There is a literature outlining the issues withdeveloping a "gold standard corpus" (GSC) of language around databeing mentioned and used in analysis in academic publications, sincecreating one is time-consuming and expensive (<em>9</em>) In Chapter 4“Standardized Metadata, Full Text and Training/Evaluation for ExtractionModels”, Sebastian tk and Alex Wade describe the need for, andstrategies for collecting, large sets of annotated full-text sources foruse as training data for supervised learning models developed in theRich Context Competition. Dataset Extraction, the NLP task at the coreof the Rich Context Competition, relies on a high-quality set of fulltext sources with metadata annotations. Developing such a corpus must bedone strategically, as full-text articles and their metadata areorganized inconsistently across their sources. The corpora gathered foruse as training data for the Competition required ad-hoc manual labor tocompile. Here, authors describe the legal, technological and humanconsiderations in creating a corpus. They dictate the scale of full-textdata needed, and the impact that an interdisciplinary (e.g spanningmultiple domains) corpus has on that scale. They suggest development ofa corpus with open-access text resources, use of human-annotators forlabeling of full-text, and attention to the mix of domains that may bein a corpus when developing models. There is a separate challenge of developing a common understanding ofwhat a dataset is. Developing standard ontologies is a fundamentalscientific problem, and one that is often in the domain of libraries andinformation scientists. Although some measure of linguistic ambiguity islikely to be unavoidable in the social sciences given the complexsubject matter, even modest ontologies that minimally control thevocabulary researchers use would have important benefits. In Chapter 5,“Metadata for Administrative and Social Science Data”, Robert B. Allendescribes a framework for the application of metadata to datasets,details existing metadata schema, and gives an overview of thetechnology, infrastructure and human elements that need to be consideredwhen designing a rich metadata schema for describing social sciencedata. Allen describes three types of metadata - structural, administrative anddescriptive; and emphasizes the growth needed in descriptive metadata,which are characterized by semantic descriptions. Allen describesexisting metadata schemas which accommodate domain-specific metadataschema, like the W3C DCAT, and the unique semantic challenges faced bysocial science as opposed to natural sciences - in particular thatconcepts - e.g. “family”, “crime” -  are less well-defined, anddefinitions change across sub-domains. He considers data repositoriesand describes the essential role of metadata in making such repositoriessearchable and therefore useful. He touches on several prominent datarepositories in the social and natural sciences and describes theirmethods of gathering metadata and how the metadata supports servicesoffered, like search, computing environments, preservation of data forarchives, and logging of the history of a dataset and its provenance.Allen describes other challengings in creating and maintaining metadata,prompted by things like changes in technology that yield data streams,and changes in metadata standards. He discusses some of the technologyunderlying data repositories; in particular data cubes for data storagethat facilitate data exploration and retrieval; containerization andcloud computing enabling sharing and reproducibility; and collectionmanagement systems which can provide metrics on usage, like number ofdownloads, maintenance of datasets, etc. Section 3:===========Chapter 6, by the Allen AI team, describes their overarching approach.The team used a named entity recognition model to predict datasetmentions. For each mention, they generated a list of candidate datasetsfrom the knowledge base. They also developed a rule based extractionsystem which searches for dataset mentions seen in the training set,adding the corresponding dataset IDs in the training set annotations ascandidates. They then use a binary classiﬁer topredict which of these candidates is a correct dataset extraction. Whilethis approach was eventually the winning approach given the design ofthe corpus and the scoring mechanism, it suffers from being too fragilefor general application, since it is necessarily corpus dependent. Thatteam did not devote substantial time to identifying fields and methods.Chapter 7, by the KAIST team, describes a very different approach. Theygenerated their own questions about dataset names and use a machinelearning technique to train the model for solving question answeringtask. In other words, questions suitable for finding dataset names suchas “What is the dataset used in this paper?,” are generated and thequestion answering model is trained to find the answers to thosequestions from the papers. Furthermore, the resulting answers from themodel are filtered by types of each word. For example, if an answercontains words with organization or agency types, then this answer islikely to include the actual dataset names. They also were quiteinnovative with identifying research fields, by using Wikipedia as thesource, and methods by using machine learning techiquesChapter 8, by the GESIS team, also used a Named Entity Recognitionprocedure. However, their design was module-based approach and theydeveloped tools that can be used separately but also as parts of a dataprocessing pipeline. For identifying research methods and fields, theyexploited the Social Science Open Access Repository maintained at GESIS– Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences. They also used the ACLAnthology Reference Corpus which is a corpus of scholarly publicationsabout computational linguisticsChapter 9, by the DICE team at Paderborn University, also used a NamedEntity Recognition approach. They trained an Entity Extraction modelbased on Conditional Random Fields and combined it with the results froma Simple Dataset Mention Search to detect datasets in an article. Forthe identification of Fields and Methods, they essentially used searchstring to find embedded wordsChapter 10, by Singapore Management University, was an incompletesubmission, with a very interesting approach. They used datasetdetection followed by implicit entity linking approach to tackle datasetextraction task. They adopt weakly supervised classification forresearch methods and fields identification tasks utilizing SAGEKnowledge as an external source and as a proxy for weak labels.Section 4: Looking forward==========================In Chapter 11, researchers from Digital Science describe the role userengagement plays in creating rich context around datasets, which aretake on properties of ‘first class research objects’ (like journalarticles) in that they are published as distinct research outputs intheir own right.  Authors lay out a set of challenges in the sharing ofdatasets and dissemination of dataset metadata, and articulate goals increating infrastructure to answer these challenges. As technology has yielded ever larger streams of datasets available forsocial science research, two critical, interrelated elements ofinfrastructure have not kept apace: information infrastructure, andcultural infrastructure.  Information infrastructure refers to contentof interest to the rich context competition models - journal articles,datasets, and their metadata (including details on the data stewards,usage of the datasets in research, and code used to prepare and analyzedatasets). Cultural infrastructure refers to the incentives and valuepropositions in place to encourage individual data stewards, data usersand experts to share datasets and contribute metadata on datasets.Cultural infrastructure around datasets do not fit into the existentculture of research publications. In venturing to build out information infrastructure around datasets, wemust consider how concepts like versioning, reproducibility, and peerreview carry over to datasets. Further, how do metadata carry over, whenthere is so much variability in what we mean when we say dataset?Incentives around data sharing, dataset curation, and metadatacontribution are even slimmer than in publishing, where there exists aculture of “publish or perish.” This question must be resolved if wewish to enrich the context around datasets to make them more efficientlyconsumable. The future agenda is described in the concluding chapter by Paco Nathanand Ian MulvanyThe first step is to create a corpus of research publications to be usedfor training data during the Rich Context Competition.The next step will be a formal implementation of the knowledge graph,based primarily on extensions of open standards and use of open sourcesoftware. That graph is represented as an extension of a DCAT-compliantdata catalog. Immediate goals are to augment search and discovery insocial science research, plus additional use cases that help improve theknowledge graph and augment research.In the longer term, the process introduces human-in-the-loop AI intodata curation, ultimately to reward researchers and data stewards whosework contributes additional information into the system. With thislatter step, in the broader sense Rich Context helps establish acommunity focused on contributing code plus knowledge into the researchprocessReferences==========1. C. F.

We present conceptual lessons learned from a machine learning competition held to au-tomate the discovery of datasets, research methods and fields in these research publications. Obtained information from the competition can be used to inform the debate about the added value of the used (micro) data. Being able to measure societal benefits of data access is important to put funding decisions on an objective basis, since much research data is generated by publically funded researchers or available from official institutions. The obtained information from the competition can also be used to build up a user-centric dataset recommendation system. Both of these outcomes will elevate the current knowledge generating process of empirical research in a research data centre.### Table of contents1. Introduction2.

Only microdata can uncover interdependencies between entities and document disparate global develop-ments. Making microdata available for independent research is subject to legal requirements that are designed to prevent the disclosure of information concerning an individual person or business entity. At Deutsche Bundesbank, the Research Data and Service Centre (RDSC) is tasked with making microdata available for independent research while simultaneously ensuring statistical confidentiality.To strengthen effective quantitative research through optimal microdata usage, the RDSC has engaged in a series of projects that are targeted at enhancing user experience. One specific project currently pur-sued by the RDSC is the development of a microdata recommendation system, which is based on how microdata is being used in empirical research. Describing microdata from the usage in publications dis-tinguished this approach from traditional metadata for researchers, which is largely based on how data is produced.Empirical research papers are an obvious source of information about dataset usage. A useful microdata recommendation system needs to rely on a corpus of dataset usage, as large as possible. Hand-curating such a sufficiently large corpus is prohibitively labor-intensive and error-prone. Therefore, being able to automatically retrieve the necessary information from research papers lays the groundwork for any future implantation of such a recommendation system. The competition is an important first step and proofs data set extraction from research publications to be feasible and scalable.We present lessons learned from the machine learning competition held to automate the discovery of datasets, associated research methods and fields in social science research publications. In doing so, we show our insights about dataset taxonomies from our experience in a research data center and from designing a machine learning competition. We do this with a background of all authors in social science.We refer the readers interested in the more technical aspect of the task of extracting dataset citations from publications to later chapters.Extracting dataset citations from publications is a fairly difficult task because of the variety of dataset ci-tation formats and the absence of training data. Besides empirical research support, the gained infor-mation is the basis to provide value for policy purposes in the G20 context. For example, by providing researchers with information about the use and availability of microdata previously not being available in a systematic way, the results of this competition and the ensuing microdata recommendation system are a step towards reducing data gaps that have been diagnosed in the aftermath of the financial crisis.On a broader level, the outcome of the competition contributes to the ongoing digitalization efforts of the Deutsche Bundesbank. Extracting relevant information from research papers as an unstructured data source broadens the value of unstructured, underexplored, data. Thus, the project presents a well-defined use-case to turn tacit knowledge into codified knowledge by converting text into relatively well-structured information. As a concrete first institutional implementation of competition results, microdata-based research will be supported by turning unstructured information into a useful source of reference for researchers.### Insights from a research data centre perspective#### BackgroundThe overriding principle of Bundesbank – and other Central Banks, National Statistical Institutes and Of-ficial International Institutions - when working with micro data is compliance with the statutory secrecy and data protection requirements, and thus maintaining the confidentiality of the information submitted by the reporting agents. European and national legal provisions regulate both the user group and the access channels to micro data, prescribe the required degree of data anonymisation and oblige data providers and data recipients to maintain data confidentiality at all times.In response to the increased internal and external demand for microdata and the data confidentiality re-quirements, in 2013 the Bundesbank set up the Integrated Microdata - based Information and Analysis System (IMIDIAS) and established the Research Data and Service Centre (RDSC) (for a detailed moti-vation, refer to Kalckreuth, 2014 and Bender and Staab, 2015). The RDSC applies a standardised pro-cedure to generate high-quality datasets that cover a large part of data requests for research purposes. Thereby, the RDSC grants internal and external researchers’ access to selected Bundesbank microdata and serves as an interface between data producers and data users.Requests to use microdata are first reviewed pursuant to legal requirements. The RDSC provides access to anonymized datasets on banks, securities, investment funds, enterprises and households, all of which can be accessed at dedicated researcher workstations or for most of the Bundesbank’s surveys – as for the Panel on Household Finances (PHF) study – the RDSC offers so called scientific use files. Data access and the underlying legal requirements are described in detail by Schönberg (2018).In addition, the RDSC provides information and advice to researchers on data selection, data content and analytical approaches. Together with the relevant statistical experts, it ensures that the microdata provided are documented in detail and archived. In doing so, the RDSC works according to globally rec-ognized standards and was accredited as a research data centre (RDC) by the German Data Forum (“Rat für Sozial- und Wirtschaftsdaten”).To date, metadata in the RDSC is provided to research using structured data reports. They are an es-tablished and well-functioning tool to convey information linearly from the data producers via the RDSC to the data users. To go a step further, efforts are underway in the RDSC to document microdata from the usage side. This relevant source of information has not been considered yet, because necessary in-formation on which datasets are used in which publication has not been broadly available to date. The competition changes this for the first time.Potential of such data documentation from the usage side is manifold. Examples include newly arriving researchers, who get to see, what other researchers did with the data. At a glance, one can directly see potential for linkages with other micro datasets if others have done it. Data producers benefit from feed-backs on potential data gaps or limitations of the used data (which goes back to the initial institutional motivation for creating a research data center). Thereby a circular information flow is created by allowing feedback loops.A main principle of the RDSC is to give free access to Bundesbank micro data for independent research. Motives for doing so are to get feedback on the data (use published research results to increase the internal data knowledge) and to strengthen evidence-based policy-making by Bundesbank itself. For fulfilling both of these tasks, the RDSC has to ensure microdata is used effectively by providing excellent services. Implementing potential for structured feedback from researchers back to data production and new research enables an improving empirical knowledge generating process.#### The knowledge generating process of empirical research in the RDSCThe knowledge generating process of empirical research in the RDSC can be organised along the four key dimensions (i) data services, (ii) research, (iii) publication, and (iv) (structured) user specific knowledge. <img src="./combined_images/20190614_Figure1.jpg" />Figure 1: The four dimensions of the knowledge generating process of empirical research in the RDSCData Services comprises raw microdata and comprehensive documentation of the data both of which the RDSC compiles together with the data producing units in Bundesbank. [^footnote1] Furthermore, the data ser-vices dimension also includes the methodological improvement of microdata through e.g. applying rec-ord linkage techniques to facilitate the creation of new datasets for research. Finally, the RDSC also of-fers advisory services to potential and existing microdata users on topics such as e.g. dataset selection or analytical options.[^footnote1]: Data producers in different departments across Bundesbank compile, e.g. microdata, indicators, or time series.The second dimension of the knowledge generating process of empirical research in the RDSC is re-search. After the application of a researcher is approved by the RDSC, researchers conduct their re-search project in a secure environment designed to ensure ongoing compliance with internal data policies and external government regulations. For most microdata this requires researchers to be physically present at the premises of the RDSC in order to analyse the data. Furthermore, only strictly anonymised research outcomes may be used outside of the secure environment.Researchers as users of data services produce research outcomes. These outcomes – after data confi-dentiality clearance – sometimes take the form of publications, which present results to the interested public in a form optimized for human consumption as unstructured text. These publications contain knowledge accumulated by researchers about data usage over time (experience), e.g., knowledge about dataset particularities, which in turn could be utilised to inform the debate on how to improve data servicesExamples of user specific knowledge acquired by researchers include:• How data is used (e.g. additional data cleaning, variable transformation, combining datasets, us-ing additional information)• What purposes data is used for (e.g. topics, methodology, research area)• What kinds of analyses or techniques have been tried and are used ultimately• What information about data is most valuable to get to the results, respectively which linkage or data enrichment makes renders the data most valuable.Being able to access structured user-specific knowledge through e.g. a competition enables improving data services by making discovery of data and related projects, people, and publications at Bundesbank more comprehensive and efficient. For example, knowledge harvested from publications may be used to enhance services provided by RDSC by allowing standard datasets to be tailored to the needs of re-searchers. Similarly, data producers benefit from feedback on their data, allowing them to improve data quality.The challenge is to establish such a feedback loop. If effective feedback is given and used, the microda-ta-based knowledge-generating process restarts with data services, but on a higher level. Better data services in turn allow better research, because available microdata is better described and more effec-tively used. By automatizing the feedback-loop between research, publications, knowledge, and data services, the knowledge generating process can loop faster and augment quicker. We expect this to lead to improvements in the four key dimensions of this process of empirical research in the RDSC. <img src="./combined_images/20190614_Figure2.jpg" />Figure 2: Elevating the knowledge generating process of empirical research in the RDSC to a higher level by enabling a feedback loop to data services.At the moment, this feedback loop is not present in a systematic way. The aim of the competition is to identify appropriate procedures to close the gap between publication and data services, which would enable transforming knowledge available in publications into generally re-usable knowledge to inform stakeholders (data producers, RDSC, decision makers at Bundesbank). The results of the competition will thus ultimately enable better data services which in turn will make research outcomes more efficient through the channel of a more optimal data usage.#### Added value of structured user-specific knowledgeThis section details two applications of obtaining dataset usage information from publications that would add value to the data services provided for the RDSC. First, existing applications can be optimized in a user-centric way which would lead to obtaining refined products (e.g. improved researcher recommen-dations and data documentation). Second, the case for societal investment in free data access can be empirically fortified. Positive externalities (i.e. research as a public good) suggests a less then societally optimal provision of research data and related services. Obtaining a dataset impact factor can then make the case for further investment in microdata provision by concretely showing a dataset’s impact.The structured user-specific knowledge produced during the competition may be used to inform the de-sign of a dataset proposition system for researchers. By obtaining information on dataset usage in publi-cations, data is for the first time available to construct indices on data set joint usability (and dataset maps to visualize such indices). Such an index connects datasets through actual use by researchers that combined data sets in the past. This enables recommendations, such as, “Researchers, who used dataset A, also used dataset B”.Going further, the usability index can be expanded into a measure, how well new datasets fit each other. Without needing joint dataset usage in past publications goodness-of-fit measures may be predicted based on dataset usage in the same field, using the same methods or by additional metadata similarity. This can be a valuable accelerator to effectively distribute new datasets in the research community. While both indices can be implemented using only information from the competition, extensions may enhance value to users which are based on other information such as current metadata.When thinking about user recommendations, the example is set by large online platforms. These online platforms can recommend from two dimensions of information (excluding interaction for simplicity). First, data is available on a large number of observed purchases per customer, which enables statements like “since you like products A and B, you might also like C”. Second, data is present on large numbers of observed customers per product, which enables statements like “users like you also bought”.In our setting, with the knowledge generating process of empirical research in the RDSC, we consider researchers and datasets. The universe of data users/ researchers is decently large (i.e. the first dimen-sion), but per user, we only observe a limited amount of “dataset consumption” (i.e. the second dimen-sion). Hence, we have a decent chance of recommending based on other users behaviour. However, we have only limited means of predicting a single users future datasets needs based on his past personal “dataset shopping” behaviour.However, we suspect a simpler underlying behavioural model of “data shopping” compared to shopping through large online platforms, because publishing with one dataset is not a casual purchase. Instead, it implies real commitment relating to being content with the purchase (less cognitive dissonance). Thus, we suspect that, compared to online platforms, less data points per person are needed, in order to make sensible recommendations. Also, in order to gain more of the rare information per user, we can fall back on dataset citations, i.e. “indirect data usage”, as outlined in chapter 3.A challenge in building a data-driven recommendation system is to make sure that recommended da-tasets are indeed feasible to use, i.e. constitute meaningful recommendations. Thus, besides information about datasets, additional information such as fields and methods is needed to be ingested into the system. This additional information essentially constitutes additional links between datasets that helps better align datasets. This is especially true in the finance domain where linking microdata is a common feature in empirical research.Second, the RDSC as part of a public institution has a responsibility towards its principals i.e. society. Granting data access free of charge for researchers should be backed by empirically measurable bene-fits of such data provision. Benefits from data usage can justify societal investment in free data access. However, measuring societal benefits through data access is not obvious at first glance. One possible starting point of approximating societal benefits of data access can be to measure the creation of knowledge [^footnote2] created by specific datasets.[^footnote2]: In our model, we have called this knowledge user specific knowledge. Here the knowledge is in that sense specific, that it can be used to fulfil the task of Bundesbank in a better wayOne can argue that added value of providing administrative microdata is the marginal benefit relative to the second-best comparable commercial database, if such a database exists. Also, one can argue that a dataset, which enables causal evidence, adds more value to societal knowledge, compared to previously available datasets, from which only correlations could be deduced if an important goal is to inform the policy debate. However, both of these methods require identifying which empirical result from a publica-tion can be attributed to which dataset.### Lessons learned from competition#### Related literatureExtracting dataset citations from publications is a fairly difficult task because of the variety of dataset ci-tation formats and the absence of training data (for a recent overview of data retrieval see Koesten et al., 2019). Boland et al (2012) propose a weakly supervised approach, using a pattern induction method for the detection of study references in full texts. They use a corpus of 259 publications from the Social Science Open Access Repository (SSOAR). They use a bootstrapping approach, starting with a small corpus of manually created training instances. The resulting system InfoLink now informs SSOAR.Boland and Mathiak (2015) describe dataset extraction as a twofold task, finding dataset citation string and following entity resolution (match the string to the correct entity/ DOI). Concerning entity resolution, they report the difficulty of broad survey dataset citations that ignore data variability (such as years, ver-sions, questionnaire variants, etc.), motivating a dataset taxonomy. Named dataset citations are often underspecified allowing identification of the survey but not of the precise dataset (which of multiple sub-samples, aggregation levels, survey modes, etc.).Zhang et al (2016) also use a bootstrapping approach to extract dataset citations from 116 computer science journals publications. Ghavimi et al. (2016) use a similar approach for social science papers finding datasets with well-documented metadata. According to them, only 25% of all dataset citations are given in the references, highlighting the unstructured citation culture for datasets. We advance from these with an environment with less available dataset metadata and a corpus of publications from a va-riety of fields for our purposes. To tackle this, we continue with a larger hand-curated annotated corpus.Metadata schemas for datasets are available, such as DataCite metadata schema and the da|ra metadata schema, which complies with the DataCite schema (Helbig et al. 2014). They offer dataset taxonomies and standardized citation propositions, however their categories do not optimally support automatic search and extraction, if no unique dataset identification (such as a DOI) is used. In the con-text of central banks that provide microdata, recent progress has been made in the context of INEXDA. A metadata standard (in line with DataCite) has been developed (Bender et al. 2018) and datasets pro-vided by the RDSC are all DOI registered.Improving dataset citation is high on the scientific agenda in recent years. This notably includes promot-ing widespread usage of persistent and unique dataset identifiers. As available datasets spread across a large number of databases, identification of datasets is important for reproducibility and to credit data creation efforts to incentivize data creation and publication (Lagoze and Vilhuber 2017, McMurry et al. 2017, Mooney and Newton 2012). If unique and persistent dataset identification in publications were available, Ball and Duke (2011) raise the idea of dataset impact factors with such information.#### Dataset mentionsThis section presents lessons that we learned throughout the duration of the competition. We organise this section around the three sets of information that where the main focus of the competition: datasets mentions, research fields, and (statistical) methods used. We begin by describing our a priori expectation of what a dataset is. We did not delve into definitions of a dataset but rather considered it sufficiently defined for our purposes (as empirical social scientists and for the competition).Since our approach depends on getting to know the user-perspective, we thought it plausible to let usage in empirical papers define a dataset for the purpose of the competition. Having a background in working at a large provider of financial data, we had a vague idea that all datasets would look like those the RDSC provides access to, which consist mostly of collections of structured data in matrix or database form. These datasets typically are defined by a name and with a well-defined scope, thus allowing clear citation, probably including a unique dataset identifier (such as a Digital Object Identifier, DOI).##### Lesson #1: datasets fall into two broad categoriesSince the corpus of publication used for the competition spanned different domains (like healthcare, ed-ucation, and others), we quickly realized that our dataset image had an econocentric bias. In social sci-ence, we learned, datasets can be categorized into two broad categories for the purposes of extraction. First, there are named datasets, i.e. well defined, usually large-scale and publicized datasets (e.g. Com-pustat).Generally, named dataset mentions are short strings in the publications, have commonly used abbrevia-tions (e.g. MMSR), and often containing institution name or name of commercial data vendor. Some-times (rarely, but increasingly) these datasets can be identified by a unique digital object identifier (DOI). These datasets are usually well-defined in scope and time, with formal documentation available. While data is usually collected with a specific purpose in mind, such datasets are be used across multiple pa-pers and research domains.The second dataset category is what we call created datasets. By created dataset we understand da-tasets usually collected or built by authors of a publication for the purpose of analysing one specific re-search question. Often, created data comes in the form of small-scale surveys, (structured) interviews, or randomized controlled trials, RCTs. Such data normally does not have a trademark name, but instead one or multiple paragraph descriptions in the publication. Dataset information is blended together with information on data collection and sampling methods. Data reference at its most condensed form then comes in a structure like “we interview a given number of participants in a given region suffering from a given disease and code responses in the following way”.In contrast to named datasets, created datasets usually are not referred to by a specific string or com-monly used abbreviation. Data collection is usually paper specific, and the universe of existing datasets are not easily searchable. This makes it hard for text mining algorithms to correctly extract strings refer-ring to dataset entities. Specific created datasets are harder to use for follow-up research, and reproduc-ibility is given only if publishers provide data together with the paper. Therefore, the lack of unique iden-tification and search terms renders data collection potentially redundant and dataset spread not optimal.##### Lesson #2: Fractions of dataset category are domain specificThroughout the competition duration it became clear that the fraction of named and created datasets varies across social science domains. Since different fields of social sciences rely on different identifica-tion techniques and differing potentials for conducting RCTs, the predominantly used data sources natu-rally vary. This has important repercussions for designing a competition, since algorithm performance and later recommendation system performance varies with the input corpus and the application field.The number of datasets used per empirical paper (linked data) also varies across research areas. This number is also dependent on named vs. created datasets. In fields with widespread use of multiple da-tasets at once, the added value of recommending additional useful data might be expected to be higher than in fields that create study-specific data every time. Conversely, one could argue that the marginal utility of adding additional datasets is decreasing.The optimal way forward is to start a data recommendation system for research field with higher ex-pected marginal utility from additional datasets. In our view, these are research areas with widespread usage of named datasets. Named datasets are constructed without the concrete research question in mind. That is why information to answer a particular research question often has to be obtained from more than one data source and is particularly true in empirical economic and finance research.##### Lesson #3: Unique identification of datasets remains an issueFrom the distinction above, one could make the argument that named datasets are easier to identify than created datasets. However, this is not the case, because the same dataset name can refer to multiple subsamples or waves of same datasets, and it is unclear where to make distinctions between dataset entities. This makes it difficult to identify the mentions referring to the same data points. Issues are, just to name a few, different time periods or subsamples, different states of data and states of knowledge, computational data pre-processing or enrichment steps. These identification issues render the current task of entity resolution of extracted dataset mentions complicated.Unique dataset identification carries significant repercussions for reproducibility purposes, where identi-fying the exact data used for a study is paramount. For reproducibility purposes, the current solution to this dataset identification problem is the direct data upload to the publisher together with the publication. This is neither storage-efficient for large datasets nor feasible in the case of confidential microdata. A more flexible way to solve this issue is to assign unique identifiers (DOIs) to the datasets.With a DOI (identifying the exact time frame, sampling universe, data version, wave, aggregations, state of knowledge, etc.), datasets are identified and quantitative research using confidential microdata is re-producible. To make lives easier, DOIs also drastically facilitate the automatized extraction of well-defined datasets from publications (comparable to largely standardized citations of other publications, allowing easy retrieval of publication networks, etc.).Summarizing, if we successfully identify datasets and solve the issue of entity resolution, we can link and propose created datasets and thereby enable further research with such data, which takes up a notable fraction of publications in certain fields. While this task is harder than for named datasets, the potential for improvement remains larger as of today. For created datasets, too, DOI usage would be desirable; however encouragement or enforcement to use DOIs is harder in this case, because of a larger target group – authors instead of a limited number of data stewards. Even in case of widespread DOI usage for named datasets, the competition algorithms yield valuable results through the created datasets extraction in order to allow referencing and making available datasets used in the past for further analysis.##### Lesson #4: Datasets mentions could indicate used for analysis vs. citedAfter a discussion about dataset types and usage in fields, the last lesson that we learned about datasets concerns the mention of datasets in publications. These mentions come in two types. First, datasets used for empirical analysis and second, cited datasets in the literature review or references. Dataset citations (without empirical usage) can generally occur in the literature review section, even in theoretical, methodological papers, e.g. a given paper might report summary statistics based on datasets (“Author Y uses Compustat to…”). Sometimes differences between cited and used datasets are only semantic in nature. In well-written papers, the difference is usually fairly easy to distinguish for humans, but less clear for algorithms.A key lesson we learned, is to think ahead of time, what the informational need is for the use-case at hand, used or cited datasets. Note that in an optimal setting, if information were available on the universe of datasets used for analysis in papers and on all publication citations, dataset citations would be redundant. This comes from the fact that a dataset citation in one publication is based on a dataset used for analysis in another publication and can be linked via available literature citations.While literature citations are mostly standardized within research domains and are relatively straightfor-ward to extract (hence publication networks / publications maps exist), information on used datasets in papers remains incomplete (even after the competition). Because of this, for the competition, we asked for used and cited datasets. It is important to note, that extracted dataset citations are always incomplete, since some authors report aggregate statistics from a different paper, but not the data behind (“Smith et al show…”).If well separated, through extracted dataset citations, one obtains a “dataset map”, thus the “closeness of datasets”, and network measures such as centrality distinguishing important datasets (“nodes”). Through extracted empirical dataset usage on the other hand, one obtains relevant information for our purposes, namely information relating to dataset similarity and joint usage possibilities from the user perspective. However, for our envisioned recommendation system, usage of cited data (“indirect” data usage) is a valuable feature, since it yields more limited data on dataset “purchases” of a user.As training data for the algorithms it is important to include theoretical literature, essays, etc. in the corpus of publications. Obviously, this is helpful for algorithms to correctly identify true negatives, i.e. correctly identifying theoretical papers. For this task, distinguishing between cited and used datasets becomes relevant once again, because clearly separating theoretical papers that merely cite data from empirical papers depend on such a distinction.#### Fields and MethodsThe competition also asked participants to extract information about research fields and methods used in the publication. We want to gather this information from the user side, because data producers and annotators do not necessarily foresee all usage potential for their data and the point of our envisioned system is to increase user value. One such idea is to construct dataset similarity indices from the usage side, information is relevant not only on existing joint usage by others (“people like you often used dataset Y, too” – hence dataset extraction), but also on new dataset or linkage potentials (“this might also interest you based on your preferences”). For this, information is necessary on the context, how datasets are used.##### Lesson #5: Think before you act: define fields and methodsTo obtain the most relevant categories of research fields, we did not provide any thesauri to the compe-tition, on purpose. The rationale behind this was to see the unhindered creativity of teams, which availa-ble information sources they would use or not use (e.g. reference datasets, Wikipedia, archive.org, other repositories, thesauri, statistical clustering techniques, etc.). On the other hand, thesauri limit the cata-logue of potentially identifiable fields and methods, thus prohibiting new methods and fields to be identi-fied in fast-changing modern research areas. Also thesauri might disturb algorithm performance, since algorithm might be forced to categorize topics and fields to older or less exact categories than necessary.However, using thesauri does have well-known advantages, as any librarian will confirm. These ad-vantages include easy clustering of similar fields and methods and a manageable category set of predic-tions. For field predictions, we generally face a fine line between too broad predictions (safe, but unin-formative) and too narrow predictions (narrow, but potentially wrong). A potential way out is backward induction here – we can present differently aggregated predictions for fields to users and get feedback from them (let users rank usability – “Was this helpful to you?”).Concerning our definition of methods for the purpose of the competition, two questions arise. The first is the definition of statistical methods (i.e. inclusion of sampling methods, qualitative methods, etc.). Sec-ondly, there are multiple statistical methods in a publication (besides the main causal analysis, there can be methods reported for data preparation, sampling, baseline results, robustness checks, descriptive statistics, etc.) and issues of potential weighting of importance of these.For useful new recommendations to be provided to researchers, we decide to include in statistical methods all methods that describe potential for a merge of datasets / joint usability, hence to include all the above listed. We consider a broad definition of methods, not only including high-level statistical methods, such as ordinary least squares, but also including the observed unit, time period or even re-gression equations. If two papers then use different datasets in the same field using the same methods, there is a relatively high likelihood that those datasets can be linked or used together to create new in-sights.#### DiscussionSeveral decades ago, publication citation networks were constructed and to our knowledge no such un-dertaking has yet been done for datasets. This comes from the fact that no curated training data corpus is readily available in decent quality. Since no such data is available, we manually annotate papers for the competition and now propose to go forward with this in a larger scale.We would have no need for this competition in a world with universal dataset identifier usage (such as DOIs). In such a scenario unique identification and standardized citations of datasets would be readily available. Since DOIs only now and slowly gain widespread application for datasets in social science, our task is a 1:n mapping of publications to datasets without unique identifiers. For scientific papers many journals already provide DOIs for papers.There are ongoing efforts by journals to have all used data published for reproducibility reasons. Incen-tivizing researchers to provide unique identification of datasets used in papers is a logical next step. This will ensure reproducibility for confidential microdata and facilitate our use-cases. In the meantime, we show a way forward to learn from the current state of information and analytically use presently available information.The competition highlights that datasets can be categorized in different dimensions for the purposes of extracting dataset mentions from publications. We propose a binary distinction of datasets into named as opposed to created datasets. As named datasets, we consider formal, large datasets by commercial or official institutions, often referenced in relatively standardized forms as commonly used abbreviations. Created datasets are those created for the specific purpose of one research question in mind. They are generally described in less standardized paragraphs. Usage of named versus created datasets varies across research areas.Also varying across research areas is the number of datasets used per empirical paper. This number al-so depends on the spread of formal, named datasets as opposed to created datasets for single studies. In fields with widespread use of multiple datasets at once (linked data), the added value of recommending additional useful data might be expected to be higher than in fields that create study-specific data every time. Conversely, one could argue that the marginal utility of adding additional datasets is decreasing. The optimal way forward is to start a data recommendation system for research field with higher expected marginal utility from additional datasets.### ConclusionsIn this competition, we asked teams to extract datasets, fields and methods from a corpus of hand-annotated research publications. The value of the extracted information lies in informing a user-centric dataset recommendation system and thereby enabling optimal and timely spread of available datasets throughout the research community. Furthermore, such information allows us to compute dataset impact factors by obtaining data-driven information on which datasets underlie high-quality research outputs. This in turn is a proxy for societal benefits of data provision by research data centres, thus motivating in-vestment in data access infrastructure.We introduce a circular model of the knowledge generating process, which increases in levels. From da-ta services, research is conducted, publications are published and user-specific knowledge is generated. Having such knowledge on dataset usage, data services in turn can be improved. Thereby the circle repeats on a higher level. The current competition works on strengthening the knowledge pillar as well as the transmission mechanisms from publications to knowledge to improved data services. [^Footnote3][^Footnote3]: For the future, ongoing effort is needed to support all four “corners of the circle” / “pillars of the level model”. The current competition strengthens the arrow from publication to knowledge and structures gained knowledge to improve data services. To support the data services pillar – for example -, digital RDC environments with facilitated access processes like a “data stewardship module” will in our view improve data access.Automatic processing of generated knowledge in publications becomes increasingly available with mod-ern text analysis tools. Extracting such information is important, because timely and optimal usage of gained results increases the speed, by which findings can be incorporated into data services and thereby next-level research is enabled in turn. To further improve automatic processing, minimum standards for dataset taxonomy are needed. Harmonized metadata schemas for data sets – like the INEXDA metadata schema for central banks and statistical offices (compliant with and building upon DataCite) – offer such an approach.The competition showcased that information extraction of the necessary information for such systems is possible. The delivered prototype algorithms prove this claim. With the proof of concept, there is a more substantiated case for investing in a larger hand-curated training corpus of annotated research papers. On the road towards a user-centric dataset recommendation and metadata system, the competition forced us to clarify organizational needs and methodological aspects.For the way forward, it is important to note the importance of the research area on the strategic path to-wards a unified user-centric microdata recommendation system. The choice of the research domain will greatly influence algorithm performance. Since human effort in creating training data is expensive, one should deliberately pick research domains to start with. This arises because text extraction algorithms (and humans) struggle with informally described created datasets. The low-hanging fruits of prototyping dataset recommendation systems, usability indices etc. are easier to implement for research areas with a largely formalized dataset citation culture (however ultimately potential for benefits may well be larger in other research areas).### References- Ball, A., and M.

This change is being driven by two keyfactors: First, the volume of research data that we have available isgrowing rapidly; and, second, our ability to process and analyse thesedata is growing as computers become faster and algorithms become morepowerful. While many researchers welcome having more data to work with,the challenges in this new data-rich research world are not trivial.The volumes of data that researchers have had to work with have beensteadily on the rise for many years. Big Science projects such as thoserun by CERN have led the way in creating international infrastructuresfor sharing, processing and analysing large datasets. In a very realsense, the Internet itself is the result of the need for a globalinfrastructure to support science. Grid computing is another piece ofinfrastructure that was developed to support large internationalcollaborations. Looking at the research world from a high enough vantagepoint and focusing on these large projects, however, misses thechallenges generated by a second wave of advances.While many researchers now have large volumes of data, the technologiesdeveloped to support the cutting-edge research projects of more than 20years ago have become commoditised and are available to many researchersat a fraction of their original cost: storage is cheap and data transferis fast. Technological issues are not, for the most part, at the centreof today’s challenges for our increasingly data-centric research world.Rather it is infrastructure of a different sort that now needs to bedeveloped to support the research requirements of today.In this short article, we discuss the needs of today’s research systemfor investment in two critical pieces of infrastructure that have notkept pace with their technological counterparts mentioned above. Thesemissing pieces are information infrastructure and culturalinfrastructure. Both of these challenges are addressed in DigitalScience’s Rich Context project. Through this project, our aim is toprovide ‘enriched’ information infrastructure around datasets. Thisinformation includes details of the approach to data stewardship,context of usage, code applied to the dataset in its production, as wellas code applied to the data to derive further results or translate itfor practical uses. All these factors add critical elements to theresearch infrastructure. The cultural infrastructure involves creatingthe incentives, triggers and frameworks that encourage the datasetstewards, experts and users to contribute to these critical informationelements.Information Infrastructure————————–It is important to understand that any successful informationinfrastructure for research data will necessarily be deeply linked withthe culture of research. For clarity of presentation, we have decided topresent the challenges of the current information infrastructure andthose of our current cultural norms separately. However, at each stageit is clear that each influences the other.Information infrastructure can be defined as the collection of processesand artefacts that are foundational to today’s scholarly communications.A simplified model of scholarly communications would have artefacts likejournals, journal articles, article metadata and citations. Theprocesses are peer review and scholarly search.The members of the Royal Society did not have today’s world in mind whencreating <em>Philosophical Transactions</em>, the first ever scientificjournal, 350 years ago. The infrastructures that have built up aroundresearch publication since that time are powerful and persistent throughtheir ubiquity. Until very recently, we expected articles to be groupedinto journals, and published on a particular date. We expect there to bea version of record that is in some sense the definitive record of apiece of research.But heavy use of data in a research problem, or data sharedcollaboratively among colleagues across a research field, changes thedynamic around the research record. Fields that use data increasinglypublish those data as a distinct output from a research article. Datahas become a principal research output, but lacks the infrastructurethat we have built up around the journal article (some experiments like“data journals” have had only limited success, given that a static and“flat” article is not a natural fit for publishing most data).A dataset can change with time for many reasons: data may be added overtime, corrections may be issued, and so on. In these cases, it may beappropriate to “version” the dataset (by issuing a persistent identifierfor a point-in-time snapshot for the dataset, allowing subsequentchanges to receive their own “versions”). But changes to a dataset mayhave a knock-on effect on the interpretation of the data and mayfundamentally alter the research result that was originally reported.Moreover, in many fields “Big Data” is so central that it not only putspressure on the community to establish an acceptable model of datapublication, but also puts significant stress on how we read, interpret,and review research as a whole.Many datasets are now so vast that we lack the ability as humans toconsume them in an easy way. Visualisation technologies and other toolsthat allow us to interact with and sample data dynamically have receivedsignificant attention in recent years, and have helped with theinterpretation of data in online environments. But it is simplyimpossible to reduce some types of data to a single figure or printabletable, as would be the case for “traditional” journal publishing. Byattempting to do so, we miss the essence of the data and risk failing tocommunicate data-driven conclusions accurately. This limitation ofcurrent publication formats (e.g. static PDF files for articles) is anissue that relates to the reproducibility crisis of modern research.Peer review is another process that must change to account for data as a“first class” research object. Historically, peer reviewers have ensuredthat a piece of research is well-communicated and correct. This level ofpeer review is difficult to apply in the context of research data. Ifdata is being published as a primary output, then it may be possible toperform a kind of peer review by applying some statistical tests to asample of the data, or by using some other appropriate technique.However, it is no longer practical in most cases to set up a parallelexperiment to reproduce data, as had been the case in years past. Acrossall contexts there are good reasons for these challenges: the experimentmay be too costly to repeat, or the conditions of the original datacollection may not be replicable (for example, surveying stress levelsof the populace during a specific political event). In addition, ethicalconsiderations such as the anonymity of those being surveyed may makecertain types of data difficult to review. Thus, we must develop robustand accepted approaches to peer review, not only for data itself butalso for those publications that are heavily based on data.A number of publishing innovations have made journal articles morediscoverable and accessible in recent years, such as preprint servers,DOIs, centralized search engines like Google Scholar and Dimensions,etc., however, these do not translate directly across to research data.Part of the reason for this is that there is a standard structure for anacademic article (e.g. abstracts, keywords, etc), which is specificallydesigned around communication to humans. Solutions designed for data todate still have a long way to go in that regard. For example, the corefields required to create a valid DataCite record are identifier,creator, title, publisher, publication year and resource type[^1]. Allother data fields are optional (e.g. location, funder, subject,contributors) due to the fundamental uncertainty in what mightconstitute research data in the future. This flexibility limits how datacan be discovered. It has taken some years for Web of Science, Googleand others to introduce functionality to search for datasets in theirdiscovery systems.Clearly, technological infrastructure for data--or lack thereof--hashuge implications for the discovery, peer review, citation practices,interpretation, and availability of data. These challenges areinterconnected with challenges we face when thinking about the culturalinfrastructure for data, as well.Cultural Infrastructure———————–There are two main aspects to cultural infrastructure: incentives andcapability. Both of these aspects are strong drivers in how researchersengage with research data, and their behaviours relating to sharing itwith others and making it available to external scrutiny.Academics do not typically take up research careers for financial gain.Rather, they choose to dedicate their lives to understanding a specificproblem partially in the hopes of discovering something that will makethem “successful” by some measure. Success, of course, can be understoodby looking at incentives for researchers. Researchers in many fields arepromoted by publishing in specific high-impact journals, leading tofunding success. Once you have demonstrated capability in this respect,there is a virtuous cycle. More funding leads to a greater chance offurther publications in the “right” journals, which leads to morefunding.There are no such incentives here for sharing data. In this context,parting with the data that underpins your research gives rise to twoconcerns. Firstly, that someone may find an error in your work anddiscredit what you have done. Secondly, that someone else may not sharetheir own data but will gladly reuse yours if you make it available,especially in fields where success is based on having more data toanalyse. That may be the difference between having a career where youare well funded, promoted and have the ability to do research in the waythat you want, and having to leave the field.A further level of inequity exists in which data-related jobs are valuedby the Academy. If a researcher happens to be particularly talented inworking with data curation, data analysis or data processing, there isno track for recognising these talents. They are unlikely to be a firstauthor on a publication in a major journal due to their data wranglingtalents, and hence they have less of a chance of career progression thanresearchers who take a more traditional “publish or perish” path withtheir work as described above.This set of perverse incentives means that people with the capability tohandle data are often incentivised to leave research. Hence, not only dowe have a problem of incentives in sharing and communicating data, butwe also have a problem in retaining people who have the capability thatwe need to structure data so that it can be shared and built upon.Capability for sharing data is the second aspect of the culturalchallenge that academia continues to wrestle with. Making data availableto others is generally accepted as a key part of the researchcommunication process. However, there are certain established normsaround when the data should be shared, and to what depth it isshared[^2]; for example, in fields where human subjects research isprevalent, there is a much more conservative attitude towards open datathan in fields like astronomy where data sharing is widely practiced,given that data can be collected by only a handful of observatories andtelescopes worldwide.In fields that are more applied, ensuring that data generated as aresult of a commercial relationship is protected is crucial. In suchfields, academics often have a better understanding of copyright,intellectual property rights and licences[^3]. But outside of thiscontext, there is a general lack of understanding of these issues andhence data are often not shared over concerns for a perceived legalbarrier.Other concerns are ethical—for example, should these data be shared ifit might infringe the rights of the subjects of the research?Researchers are beginning to become aware that, through the use ofalgorithms, some data is not as well anonymised as it may firstappear[^4]. Anonymisation of data is a research field in and ofitself[^5].Other concerns are simply practical—how do I make my data available ina way that is meaningful to others? The work associated with making adataset generically machine-readable is challenging for manyresearchers, who tend not to be experts in data handling. The workassociated with making a dataset human-understandable, reproducible andfully contextualised is often significant. However, governments andfoundations have not necessarily prioritised these activities in theirgrant programs (though this is changing)[^6]<sup>,</sup>[^7].Enriching context—————–While we at Digital Science cannot solve all the issues raised here, thepoints discussed do offer a blueprint for a generalised approach tohandling and thinking about research data and what it means to be aresearcher in the current research paradigm. We believe that asignificant step in changing the perception of data and those who handledata is to increase the contextuality of research data.There are two important pieces of infrastructure that need to beintroduced. Firstly, a version of CredIT for research data[^8], wherebyall contributors to a dataset’s feeding and care over time arerecognized, valued, and encoded in machine-readable ways<sup>.</sup> Such asystem would be crucial in providing incentives towards data sharing,both making it possible to recognize “data wranglers” who could advancetheir career in-turn, and also by making it much easier for universitiesto track and reward those who are contributing towards the kinds of openaccess that are often discussed in university mission statements andfaculty council decrees. The second piece of crucial infrastructureneeded is, a set of tools that allow research data to be discovered andcontextualised. In this section, we will focus on the latter challenge.When we built Dimensions, the ability to contextualise any piece ofresearch was a strong driver for our work[^9]. The idea that allresearch happens in a particular place at a particular time, carried outby a set of people, some of whom may be affiliated with a researchinstitution, gives a set of metadata that allows us the “weak context”of a piece of research. By “weak context” we mean that the context beingprovided gives no deep understanding of the context of an article to anon-expert and is essentially indistinguishable from standard metadata.But with modern data mining approaches, it is possible to add a “strongcontext”.Strong contextualisation of research should provide a user with richinformation about the research including funding, other researchproduced as part of the larger project (e.g. related publications,clinical trials, etc), and details of the research that was built on topof it. This information should also fit into, trends and graphicalrepresentations that offer a more complete, more rapid understanding ofhow research fits into the larger field, related fields, or the contextof the publishing journal or supporting institution. For example, for aresearch article, we should be able to quickly understand how manyresearchers are in a related field, whether the field is growing, howold the field is, how much funding has been deployed in the field, whichcountries have provided that funding, whether the field has begun thetranslation to application through patents or clinical trials, orwhether it has been used as a basis for the formulation of policy.Context can also be offered in the data that we provide to understandthe reach and influence of research.Alternative metrics (“altmetrics”) are data from the social web that runorthogonal to classic citation measures, which can be seen to addsignificant context to an article – extending our understanding of howdifferent cohorts of potential users of the research are engaging withit. For example, we can use altmetrics to understand if an article isbeing mentioned in the news, in which geographical regions it is beingnoticed, whether it is being used as part of a teaching syllabus, andmany other kinds of public and non-traditional scholarly engagement.These data can then be visualized in creative ways to add instantadditional context to engagement with a research article (see Fig. 1).<img src="combined_images/chap03_image1.png" style="width:7.27083in;height:2.52778in" /><em>Figure 1: Different types of context tracked by Altmetric.com for anyresearch output. (Reproduced by permission of Altmetric.com)</em>How datasets are used in research more broadly is another importantpiece of context that many data search engines lack. This is where theRich Context project comes in. During the Rich Context project, weexplored using Dimensions’ freely available public interface as adestination for researchers who seek context around datasets.Such context for research data and its impacts could be offered in theform of in-app badges and other “signposts” that connect data with itslarger context. Such a contextualizing badge could include not only thenumber of citations that the dataset has received, but also whether thedata has been versioned (through Figshare’s repository metadata),discussed online (through Altmetric data), and what kind of tools andinsights have been built on top of the data (through rich mining offull-text and citation data available in the ReadCube referencemanagement corpus and in Dimensions).Correctly developed and accepted by the community, this type ofinformation can make a contribution to solving many of the problemshighlighted in this article. If the correct contextual facets can bedeveloped, then recognition would be easier to assign to those who havecontributed to the process of creating and maintaining datasets. Withgreater context around them, datasets become easier to locate,understand and value. This in turn could lead to a broader evaluativeenvironment and more engagement from academics.Engagement across academia, however, is not uniform. Mechanisms need tobe provided to engage data science-focused researchers from whom moredetails of their tools, scripts and codebooks could be drawn, addingfurther value to research data. At the same time, engagement tools needto allow data scientists to leverage this information so that it isvaluable to them when they are the consumers of search results. Theseare subtly different use cases from those of standard researchers. Bymining ever more open research systems wherein data is being analyzed(e.g. Gigantum, Github, etc), we can start to integrate these othercrucial engagement contexts as well.<img src="combined_images/chap03_image2.png" alt="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/3OunhdD8OksXbG5n9dlxQZ4vHfq3ytZuYahLuNwnXG2oaJ7vSpCkCULgc_8tpapwUqzFLsALR6Xcrhl2ZgyYtvxOhg2kfoXeAJ1MoibnK0liPl2w6xhvoMye-lGtyopkM0ja1xnB" style="width:4.54331in;height:4.77604in" /><em>Figure 2: Mock-up of a research data badge helping to contextualise aset of search results.</em><img src="combined_images/chap03_image3.png" alt="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/51fefhu7zEe3Y61OD1vbe-Bl9EiBI8IUUj1FOnP7NLLexSqDO7cJrzBeuzmwUR7eC84AQKmcMwDcTKW3trd7-vnNiyelvHvEOdM_Da5OgEoTYh5lvrz8wfxWzTH2_5DJjfgwe9Ed" style="width:4.16316in;height:4.50521in" /><em>Figure 3: Mock-up of a research data badge helping to contextualise aspecific dataset.</em>In Figures 2 and 3, we have mocked up some early thinking for how acontextualized research data badge could look. This visualisation isbased on insights from the Rich Context project and uses data that couldbe mined from articles that use a specific dataset. In particular, wehave suggested four initial facets of context that both datascience-focused researchers and others could find helpful when viewing adataset:- <strong>Experts</strong> <strong>who have made use of the data</strong>, sourced from references made to the dataset in a professional context such as an industry whitepaper or policy document- <strong>Academics</strong> that <strong>cite the data</strong>, mined from citation of the dataset or ancillary data in the peer reviewed literature- <strong>End users of the data</strong>, sourced from code book references included in public code repositories- <strong>Enhancements of the data</strong>, vis-à-vis annotations and comments made on the data in public forums.In summary, we believe that, if deployed across the many environments inwhich researchers discover data (including and beyond Dimensions), thethinking behind the Rich Context project can overcome currentinfrastructural challenges to significantly extend the contextualisationof datasets. The number and variety of datasets in use in academia willcertainly expand in the future, and we can only see data becoming evenmore central to contemporary research efforts. As such, it is criticalto invest in robust infrastructures, not only to support the productionand sharing of these data, but also to change the culture and evaluativeenvironment around research data. It is only through initiatives such asthese that we will be able to solve the vast and complex sociotechnicalchallenges that face academia today.[^1]: Support.datacite.org.

Thischapter reviews current approaches and issues for metadata about numericdata and data sets that may facilitate the identification of relevantdata. In addition, the chapter reviews how metadata supportrepositories, portals, and services. There are emerging metadatastandards but they are applied unevenly so that there is nocomprehensive approach. There has been greater emphasis on structuralissues than on semantic descriptions.INTRODUCTION============Evidence-based policy needs relevant data (Commission on Evidence-BasedPolicy, 2018; Lane, 2016). Such data is valuable, but often difficult tofind and/or replicate. The FAIR Open Access guidelines suggest that,ideally, data should be Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, andReusable.[^1] Therefore, data curation and stewardship is needed.While data may include text, image, or video, here we focus on numericobservations recorded and maintained in machine-readable form. There aremany data sets of such observations available online; the DataCite[^2]repository alone contains over five million. There are many differenttypes of data sets. Data sets differ in their structure, their source,and their use. In some cases, they are single vectors of data; in othercases, they comprise all the data associated with one study or across agroup of related data sets. Following the approach of W3C-DCAT (WorldWide Web Consortium-Data Catalog Vocabulary)[^3], a data set may be acollection of related observations which is developed and managed by asingle entity such as a statistical agency. When stored as a unitonline, the data set is a digital object.Metadata consists of short descriptors which refer to a digital object.Metadata can support users in finding data sets, and enable users toknow what is in them. However, there is tremendous variability in thetypes of metadata and how they are applied. One categorization ofmetadata identifies structural (or technical), administrative, anddescriptive metadata. Structural metadata includes the organization ofthe files. Administrative metadata describes the permissions, rights,and usage. Descriptive metadata covers the contents.This chapter surveys the state of the art of metadata for numeric datasets, focusing on metadata for administrative and social sciencerecords. Administrative records describe details about the state of theworld as collected by organizations or agencies. They includegovernmental records, hospital records, educational records, andbusiness records. By comparison, social science data generally iscollected for the purpose of developing or applying theory.Section 2 describes data, metadata, and digital objects. Section 3discusses semantics. Section 4 considers repositories. Section 5describes services. Section 6 describes the techniques for documentingthe internal structure of data sets. Section 7 discussescyberinfrastructure.DATA, METADATA, AND DIGITAL DATA OBJECTS========================================A metadata element describes some attribute of a digital object. Thesimplest metadata identifies the digital object.[^4] Individual metadataelements are generally part of a set which describes attributes of adata set. Such a set of metadata elements can be structured as acatalog, schema, or frame, and restrictions can be placed on the valuesallowed for the individual elements. A fragment of an example of theSchema.org[^5] dataset schema is shown in Figure 1. Note the distinctmetadata elements in that fragment.Figure 1: Fragment of schema.org dataset schema[^6].The W3C DCAT[^7] is a schema standard for data sets that is used by manyrepositories such as data.gov. Other structured frameworks for data setsinclude the DataCite[^8] metadata schema and the Inter-universityConsortium for Political and Social Research Data DocumentationInitiative (ICPSR DDI) discussed below (Section 4.1). The catalogspecifications provide a flexible framework. For instance, DCAT allowsthe inclusion of metadata elements drawn from domain schema andontologies. Some of these domain schemas are widely used resources whichDCAT refers to as assets. For instance, spatial relationships are oftenmodeled by the Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC) standard.[^9]Many of the implementations for indexing collections of metadata schemasuse relational databases. Thus, they use SQL and support tools such asdata dictionaries. Moreover, they are often characterized by UnifiedModeling Language (UML) Class Diagrams which are common for datamodeling.SEMANTIC DESCRIPTIONS=====================Semantic data models have become widely explored. In particular, theSemantic Web utilizes nodes which are implemented with XML. RDF(Resource Description Framework) extends XML by requiring triples whichassert a relationship (property) between two identifiers:“identifier”-“property”-“identifier”. By connecting triples, RDF candefine a graph network of the relationships among a set of controlledvocabulary terms; this is the essence of linked data.RDFS (RDF Schema) extends RDF by supporting class/subclassrelationships. The classes allowed for identifiers in RDFS triples arecontrolled by domain and range parameters. Traditional thesauri have asimple hierarchical structure, the Simple Knowledge Organization System(SKOS) is an RDFS standard for a machine-processable representation ofthesauri. Many administrative and social-science-related thesauri suchas EDGAR, and those of the World Bank, and the OECD have now beenimplemented with SKOS. In addition, a knowledge graph is a model of adomain, sometimes including instances, which may be implemented in SKOS.For example, DBpedia[^10] is a knowledge graph based on Wikipedia.Some frameworks for structural descriptions of data sets include aspectsof ontologies. For example, less formal ontologies simply providedefinitions and employ RDFS. Similarly, Schema.org schemas can be usedwith micro-formats which match schema elements with passages in anonline text. Schema.org has a classification of topics and mayincorporate other systems such as FOAF (Friend of a Friend) whichincludes attributes associated with people. Formal ontologies use OWL(Web Ontology Language) to add features to RDFS. These features lendthemselves to logical inference provided that the entities andrelationships are rigorously defined.Upper ontologies provide top-down structures for the types of entitiesallowed in derivative domain and application ontologies. One of the bestknown upper ontologies is the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) (Arp, Smith, &amp;Spear, 2015), which is a realist, Aristotelian approach. At thetop-level, BFO distinguishes between Continuants (endurants) andOccurrents (perdurants) and also between Universals and Particulars(instances). Many biological ontologies have been developed based on BFOand are collected in the Open Biomedical Ontology (OBO) Foundry.There are fewer rich ontologies dealing with social science content thanthere are for natural science. One challenge is “social ontology”, thatis, developing definitions for social terms. It is difficult to defineexactly what is a family, a crime, or money. In most cases, anoperational definition or an approximate definition may suffice wherestructured documentation of the definitions are unavailable. Moreover,while social terms are especially difficult to define for vernacularspeech, it seems possible to make clear, though perhaps cumbersome,definitions for scholarly applications.DATA REPOSITORIES=================A data repository holds data sets and related digital objects. Itprovides access to the data sets and supports search. Metadata isintegral to these services at several levels. In addition to item-levelmetadata for the data sets, there can also be study-level metadata orcollection-level metadata.The Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR)————————————————————————-ICPSR[^11] is a major repository of public-use social science andadministrative data sets derived from questionnaires and surveys. TheICPSR DDI[^12] (e.g., Vardigan, Heus, &amp; Thomas, 2009) defines a catalogcode. A notable feature is a codebook which saves the exact wording ofall the questions. In addition, the ICPSR provides an index of allvariable names that are used in the data sets. DDI-Lifecycle is anextension of DDI that describes the broader context in which the surveywas administered as well as the details about the preservation of thefile (see Section 5.3).Repositories of Governmental and NGO Statistical Agencies———————————————————Statistical data collection is a core function of government. Mostcountries have national statistical agencies. While these statisticalcollections often emphasize social data, they also include relatedindicators such as agricultural and industrial output and housing, suchas Statistics New Zealand, and the Korean Social Science Data Archive(KOSSDA). European data sets are maintained in the Consortium ofEuropean Social Science Data Archives (CESSDA)[^13] and the EuropeanSocial Survey.[^14] Australia has a broad data management initiative,ANDS.[^15] Many U.S. governmental data sets are collected atdata.gov.[^16] In addition, there are many non-governmental andinter-governmental agencies such as the OECD, the World Bank, and theUnited Nations, which host data sets.Other Data Repositories———————–Many data sets are produced, curated, and used in the natural sciencessuch as astronomy and geosciences. Some of these data sets have highlyautomated data collection, elaborate archives and established curationmethods. Many of these repositories include multiple data sets for whichaccess is supported with portals or data cubes (see Section 6.1). Forinstance, massive amounts of geophysical data and related text documentsare collected in the EarthCube[^17] portal. The Science.gov portal isestablished by the U.S. Office of Science Technology and Policy. NASAsupports approximately 25 different data portals. Each satellite in theEarth Observation System (EOS) may provide hundreds of streams ofdata,[^18] with much common metadata. This provides a context analogousto study-level metadata. Likewise, there are massive genomics andproteomics data sets which are accessible via portals such asUniProt[^19] and the Protein Data Bank[^20] along with suites of toolsfor exploring them. Similarly, there are very large data sets frommedical research such as from clinical trials and from clinical practiceincluding Electronic Health Records (EHRs).Ecosystem of Texts and Data Sets——————————–Data sets are often associated with text reports. For example, the DryadDigital Repository[^21] hosts data sets from scholarly publicationswhich require the deposit of data associated with scholarly papersaccepted for publication. In addition, data sets may be cited in muchthe same way that research reports are cited. Formal citationfacilitates tracing the origins of data used in analyses and helps toacknowledge the work of the creators of the data sets. Standards havebeen developed for such citations (Martone, 2014; Silvello, 2017).SERVICES========The purpose of metadata and other aspects of information organizationand management is to provide services to users. Indeed, “servicescience” is an approach in information technology which focuses on thedesign and delivery of services rather than on underlying technologies.Search——Searching for data sets differs from the familiar web-based text searchbecause data repositories are generally hosted by either relationaldatabases or semantic triplestores. Even where the data are stored onseparate servers the metadata can be harvested and searched. This typeof federated search is supported by the Open Archives InitiativeProtocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH);[^22] both data.gov and ICPSRuse OAI-PMH.From Statistical Packages to Virtual Research Environments———————————————————-There is an increasingly rich set of analytic tools. Some of theearliest tools were statistical packages such as SPSS, R, SAS, andSTATA. These were gradually enhanced with data visualization and otheranalytic software. The current generation of tools such as Jupyter,RSpace, and eLab notebooks (ELN) integrate annotations, workflows, rawdata, and data analysis into one platform. In addition, somerepositories have developed their own powerful data exploration toolssuch as ICPSR Colectica[^23] for DDI and the GSS Data Explorer[^24].Virtual research environments (VREs) are typically organized by researchcommunities to coordinate data sets with search and analytic tools. Forinstance, the Virtual Astronomy Observation (VAO) uses Jupyter toprovide users with a robust research environment. WissKI[^25] is aplatform for coordinating digital humanities data sets which are basedon Drupal.Preservation————Lost data is often irreplaceable. Even if the data is not entirely lost,users need confidence that the quality of stored data has not beencompromised. Moreover, although data storage prices are decliningdramatically, we cannot save everything and the cost of maintaining atrusted repository remains substantial. Many of these challenges arefamiliar from traditional archives. For instance, selection policiestypical in archives could help in controlling the many poorly documenteddata sets in some repositories. Yet, prioritization is difficult[^26](Whyte &amp; Wilson, 2010).The Open Archival Information System (OAIS) provides a reference modelfor the management of archives (Lee, 2010). The OAIS framework has beenincorporated into the ICPSR DDI-Lifecycle model. The IntegratedRule-Oriented Data System (iRODS)[^27] is a policy-based archivalmanagement system developed for large data stores. It implements aservice-oriented architecture (SOA) to support best practicesestablished by archivists.Provenance records the history of an entity. This can help to ensureconfidence in its authenticity. For data in a repository, provenanceoften means tracing the history of repository operations. The history oftransitions is often recorded as event data, where the events are whathappened to the data in the dataset. Typically, provenance ontologiesinclude actors, events, and digital objects. Potentially, blockchainscould provide an even greater level of trust in digital provenance.Metadata Quality and Metadata Management—————————————-Metadata, whether for texts or data sets, needs to be complete,consistent, standardized, machine processable, and timely (Park, 2009).A metadata editor supports the assignment of quality metadata (e.g.,Gonclaves, O’Conner, et al., 2019). When collections or metadatastandards change, the repository librarian must revise metadata (Tonkin,2009). This might be particularly needed when updating metadata fromdata streams[^28] such as those from satellite downlinks or smart-citysensors.Although survey results are generally aggregated across individuals,individual-level data is sometimes very useful. Some repositories ofsurvey data include micro-data, data for the responses that individualsgave to survey questions.[^29] Currently, there are no distinct metadatatags for such data; they are embedded into repository data. Moreover,the individual level of analysis raises privacy concerns and needs to becarefully managed; at the least, access should be limited to qualifiedresearchers.Metadata registries, such as the Marine Metadata InteroperabilityOntology Registry and Repository,[^30] record usage. The Registry ofResearch Data Repositories (re3data registry),[^31] which is operated byDataCite, links to more than 2000 different repositories each of whichholds many data sets. Each of the repositories is described by there3data.org schema for the description of research data repositories(Rücknagel, Vierkant, et al., 2015).Metadata application profiles provide constraints on the types ofentities that can be included in the metadata for a given application.For instance, DCAT Application Profiles (DCAT-AP) support standardizedmetadata exchange between repositories in different jurisdictions in theEU.[^32]DETAILS ABOUT THE DATA IN DATA SETS===================================Data Cubes———-Many notable data management techniques were originally developed formanaging and processing business data.[^33] One such technique is datacubes, which support access to multidimensional data. They present dataas if it filled cells of a high-dimensional cube, even if the data willprobably not fill all of the cells. Users can generate different viewsof the data by drilling-down, rolling-up, and slicing-and-dicing acrosscells. For complex data sets, there will be many dimensions. Tofacilitate retrieval, there can be a rich pre-coordinated index forcommon queries; other queries can be implemented with slower methodssuch as hashing or B-trees.Data cubes have been extended beyond business information processing tocubes such as the Statistical Data and Metadata eXchange (<em>SDMX) used inthe financial services industry and the</em> W3C Data Cube[^34] standardthat is applied in projects such as EarthCube.Sequential Activities and Modeling Research——————————————-Entities change over time, yet knowledge representation frameworksrarely model change. In order to represent changes, models need torepresent transitions, processes, and other sequential activities. Suchmodeling is closer to the Unified Modeling Language (UML) or evenprogramming languages than to ontologies. In fact, modeling change isroutine for state machines, Petri nets, and other transition models. A“model-layer” that allows general statements to be made about sequentialactivities could incorporate both ontology and transitionals (Allen &amp;Kim, 2018).Models of sequential activities include workflows and mechanisms (e.g.,Allen, 2018). A workflow is a structure for managing a sequence ofactivities and is a natural fit for describing research methods andanalyses (Austin, Bloom, et al., 2017). The Taverna workflow tool hasbeen widely used in the MyExperiment[^35] project, which provides aframework for capturing and posting research methods and incorporatesontologies such as FOAF.Allen (2015, 2018) has proposed direct representation of entire researchreports. This approach uses a programming language that blends upperontologies with object-oriented programming to do semantic modeling.Beyond modeling events, it is also possible to use structuredargumentation and assertions in scientific research reports.Potentially, social mechanisms (e.g., Hedstrom &amp; Ylikoski, 2010) andcommunity models could be implemented. Further, highly-structuredevidence and claims might be applied to the evaluation of evidence-basedsocial policy.CYBERINFRASTRUCTURE===================Information Institutions and Organizations——————————————Libraries and archives (whether traditional or digital) have themission, and often the resources, to develop standards and maintaininformation over the long-term. As noted earlier (Section 5.3),preservation is the fundamental concern for archival collections.Information institutions often have formal collection managementstrategies, metrics, and policies. These include Web and repositorymetrics and analytics, usage statistics such as reports of how manydownloads were made from data sets, and procedures for updates andformatting standards.In addition to traditional information institutions, there are now manyother players. These new players have slightly different mandates. Forexample, Schema.org’s primary mission is to provide a structure thatimproves indexing by search engine companies. Nonetheless, theseorganizations often adopt best practices similar to those of traditionalinformation organizations.CrossRef[^36] and DataCite are DOI registration agencies. CrossRef is aportal to metadata for scholarly articles, while DataCite providesmetadata for digital objects associated with research. Increasingly, thetwo projects are coordinating. ORCID iDs[^37] are persistent digitalidentifiers assigned to authors. The emergence of structured identifierssuch as DOIs and ORCID iDs has allowed the development of services suchas VIVO[^38] and the Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG)[^39] which allowauthors to be tracked across research reports and projects, and acrosspublishers.Cloud Technologies, Software as a Service, and the Internet of Things———————————————————————We are now well into the era of cloud computing (Foster &amp; Gannon, 2017),allowing flexible allocation of computing, networking and storageresources, which facilitates Software as a Service (SaaS). Thecompatibility of the versions of software packages needed for datamanagement is often a challenge. Containers, such as those from Docker,allow compatible versions of software to be assembled and run on avirtual computer. A container could hold datasets, workflows, and theprograms used to analyze the data, making the analyses readilyreplicable. Highly-networked data centers also facilitate the Internetof Things (IoT) which will generate massive data sets such as for “smartcities”.CONCLUSION==========Data may not be useful when stand-alone without context. Some of thebiggest issues for the retrieval of information from data sets concerninformation organization, which help provide context. Metadata supportsthe discovery of and access to data sets. We need richer, moresystematic, and more interoperable metadata standards. Even moreattention to metadata would further support evidence-based policy.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS {#acknowledgments .ListParagraph}===============Julia Lane and members of NYU’s Center for Urban Science and Progressprovided useful advice and comments.REFERENCES {#references .ListParagraph}==========Allen, R.B.

The goal of the competition was to developand identify the best text analysis and machine learning techniques tofind datasets in empirical scientific publications and use thatinformation to discover relationships between data sets, researchers,publications, research methods, and fields. The results were expected tohelp to create a rich context for empirical research – and build newmetrics to describe data use. This is an open-source project, and wesought to generate models that could be continuously improved uponthrough engagement with the research community.This paper describes how the competition was designed and discusses thelessons learned.Competition DesignThe design approach followed the successful approach developed in theNatural Language Processing (NLP) domain, which developed a series ofcompetition patterns for inspiring disparate groups of researchers tohelp to carry out information tasks against text data. These includemore basic competitions where data is provided to groups and they areallowed to train and then submit a number of runs of their modelsagainst a subset of evaluation data[^1]. We were also inspired by thedesign of the 2015 PatentsView Inventor Disambiguation TechnicalWorkshop[^2].Competition Design in PhasesThe competition had two phases. In each of the two phases, competingteams were given text and metadata for 5,000 publications and single setof metadata on 10,348 data sets of interest, shared between the twophases, for use in training and testing their models. Separate5,000-publication samples were provided for each phase. The corpus[^3]included data maintained by Deutsche Bundesbank and the set of publicdata sets hosted by the Inter-university Consortium for Political andSocial Research (ICPSR). In addition, a single 100-publicationdevelopment fold was provided separate from the training and testingdata to serve as a test for packaging of each team’s model, and as aquick test of their model and the quality of its output. After the firstphase, the phase 1 holdout was also provided to phase 2 competitors toserve as additional training and testing data.All publication text provided to teams was either open access (freelyavailable) or licensed from the publisher for use in the contest. Foreach publication, participants were provided with PDF and plain textversions of each publication together with basic metadata. Copyright andlicensing around research publications limited what publications couldbe accessed, licensed, and distributed for the competition, and so ouruniverse of publications was limited to publications that were eitheropen access, or published by Sage Publications.At the end of each phase, competing teams packaged their models into adocker container. Then these containers were run on AWS by thecompetition organizers, evaluating the holdout data to generatepredictions that were used to evaluate the teams.Phase 1——-In the first phase, each publication was labeled to indicate which ofthe datasets from the master list were referenced within and whatspecific text was used to refer to each dataset. The teams used thisdata to train and tune algorithms to detect mentions of data inpublication text and, when a data set in our list is mentioned, tie eachmention to the appropriate data set.The annotated portion of the two sets of publications were drawn from aset of publications provided by Bundesbank that referenced their dataand the publications captured in the ICPSR catalog, which had beenmanually annotated as having used a particular data set for analysis.These publications were collected in a database application designed tofacilitate a mix of human and automated content analysis ofpublications. They were then filtered into two sets: those that wereopen access, and so could be shared publicly, and those that were notopen access, but that were available from our publisher partner (SagePublications, or “Sage”). Of the 5,100 total publications with annotateddata citations provided to phase 1 participants, the 2,550 publicationsin the train-test corpus (2,500) and development fold (50) were randomlyselected from the open access set, so they could be distributed freelyto all participants. The 2,500 in the holdout were randomly selectedfrom the remainder of the open access set plus those available fromSage. The un-annotated publications used in phase 1 were all publishedby Sage: the 2,550 non-annotated publications in the train-test corpus(2,500) and development fold (50) were open access publications fromSage journals. The 2,500 un-annotated publications used in the holdoutevaluation corpus were sampled from across Sage Publications’ journalholdings including non-open access journals.Both the train-test publications and the holdout publications werebroken into 2,500 publications each that used one or more of the datasets of interest for analysis, as compiled by ICPSR and Bundesbankstaff, and 2,500 publications that had not been annotated and had beenfiltered to not contain data. The data set citations were captured in aseparate data set citations JSON file. The citations for the phase 1train-test publications were provided to competition teams to use astraining data, while the citations in the phase 1 holdout were used totest the quality of each team’s model in phase 1, and given to teams asadditional training data in phase 2.Each team was allowed up to 2 test runs against the evaluation corpusbefore final submission. The final models of each group were evaluatedagainst the holdout corpus, along with a random qualitative review ofthe mentions, methods, and fields detected by the team’s model.Submissions were primarily scored on the accuracy of techniques, thequality of documentation and code, the efficiency of the algorithm, andthe quality and novelty of the methods and research fields inferred foreach of the publications.Four finalist teams were then selected to participate in the secondphase, the teams from: Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence,United States; GESIS at the University of Mannheim, Germany; PaderbornUniversity, Germany; and KAIST in South Korea.Phase 2——-In the second phase, finalists were provided with a new training corpusof 5000 unlabeled publications and asked to discover which of thedatasets from the first phase’s data catalog were used in eachpublication, as well as infer associated research methods and fields. Asin the first phase, teams were scored on the accuracy of theirtechniques, the quality of their documentation and code, the efficiencyof their algorithm, and the quality and novelty of the methods andresearch fields inferred for each of the publications.We worked with Sage to find publications in six key topic areas ofinterest for partners and future projects (Education, Health care,Agriculture, Finance, Criminal justice, and Welfare). For 28,769matches, Sage provided PDFs for each and we parsed the text (see detailsbelow), removing any that did not parse, or that resulted in file sizessmaller than 20KB, reducing the size of the sample to 25,888. We lookedat publication year and type to see if we needed to filter out olderpublications or non-academic publications, but there were few enough ofeach class (644 pre-2000 publications and 3,115 non-research articles)that we decided we’d keep all in to preserve as much potential forheterogeneity as possible. From these 25,888 publications, we thenrandomly selected a total of 10,000 with the goal to keep thedistribution across the 6 topic areas equal (so 1666 randomly selectedin 2 topic areas, 1667 randomly selected in the other 4). Then, we splitthe phase 2 corpus to give half to participants and keep half back forevaluation, maintaining equal distribution between the topic areaswithin each set of 5,000 publications.Operational IssuesConverting PDF files——————–Plain text provided for each publication was derived from thatpublication’s PDF file by the competition organizers. It was notintended to be a gold standard, but to serve as an option in case a teampreferred not to allocate resources to PDF parsing. Articles wereconverted from PDF to text using the open source “pdftotext”application. There are multiple drawbacks with this approach, such aslosing many artifacts from PDF formatting, converting multi-columnlayouts to output text, and losing tables and chart information.Competition participants were encouraged to try their own conversionprocess if this text did not meet their needs, and if so we asked themto supply documentation so we could build a set of PDF processingstrategies to reuse in the future.Data Sets———Competitors were provided with two sets of data related to detectingdata sets: 1) a catalog of all of the data sets of interest that modelswere tasked with finding in publications, including basic metadata forall and a list of verbatim mention text snippets for those that werecited in the train-test data; and 2) a subset of these data sets thatwere actually specifically annotated as having been used for analysis ina given publication.The data set catalog, provided to participants in the JSON filedata_sets.json, contained metadata for all public datasets in the ICPSRdata repository and a subset of public data sets available from DeutscheBundesbank. It includes all data sets cited in the train-test andevaluation corpora, plus many others not cited in either.A major challenge with the corpus development was that ICPSR capturedwhen a given data set was used in analysis within a particularpublication, but did not capture how that determination was made. Toprovide better data for participants, we implemented a human contentanalysis protocol to capture mention text for each data set-publicationpair included in our train-test corpus. Since we manually created thisdata, given limited time and resources, we initially only did this workfor data sets that the teams would be using for training and testing inphase 1. The list of data sets cited in a particular publication is alsonot exhaustive, because the ICPSR staff only tagged datasets that wereICPSR data and used in analysis.### Data Set Mention Annotation ProcessA long term goal is to facilitate the building of generalized modelsthat are not overly dependent on the use of formal titles of data sets.We aim for models that know of and use the language of discussing andusing data to recognize where data is discussed in a particular articleand then identify which data sets. The ICPSR data contains many explicitties between publications and data sets that would have been hard tocome by otherwise, but the lack of any indication of which parts of thepublication indicated the citation relationship made it difficult toidentify the linguistic context within the publication that captured therelationship.To make it easier for participants in the competition to efficiently andsystematically engage with the language used to discuss data, wedeveloped a content analysis protocol and accompanying web-based codingapplication so human coders could examine all of the data set citationsin our train-test corpus and capture mention text for each. Thisrequired human workers to examine each data set citation in the contextof its publication (there were X citations in 2500 trainingpublications) to identify and mark locations in the text where each dataset was referenced.Because of the manual effort required, we only did this for the 2,500train-test publications that referenced data provided to the teams. Wedid not manually annotate mention text in the 2,500 publications in thephase 1 holdout, and this made that data a little less useful for teamswhen it was given to them in phase 2.Our team of coders was spread across the United States, and so we used aweb-based application with a central database store to allow ourdistributed team of coders to work in parallel. The basic unit of workwas a publication-data set pair (so a given publication would beexamined as many times as it had different data sets cited within it).The ICPSR data set repository is very fine-grained in definition of adata set, so each year of an ongoing survey, for example, might have itsown data set. To save time, we eventually created the concept of a dataset family for these types of data sets and assigned coding for any oneinstance in a family to all other instances from that family within agiven publication. So, for example, multiple years of the same survey orlongitudinal data collection were related to each other in a family, andthen coding for one year within a paper was used for all other yearscited in that paper.The general process was as follows:each user was assigned a list of citations to code.Once the user logged in to the coding tool, they were presented with alist of the coding tasks assigned to them that included a status ofeach, so they could track which they had already completed, and a linkfor each to the coding page.Once the user loads a particular citation for coding, they are presentedwith the following coding page, and are asked to follow the codinginstructions in the codebook/documentation for the annotation tool[^4]<img src="combined_images/chap05_figure1.png" alt="image2.png" style="width:6.5in;height:3.48611in" /><em>Figure 1. Interface showing a publication and its related mentioncapturing.</em>Coders were instructed to find terms that relate to mentions of thedataset and avoid general synonyms of those terms (for example, tagging“ANS survey” instead of only “survey”). If the phrase providesadditional information about collection of the dataset, the mention istagged twice. For example, in the case of “ANS surveycollected/conducted by X”, “ANS survey” is captured first, and then “ANSsurvey collected/conducted by X”. At the same time, we tried to avoidincluding too much descriptive information of the dataset. The task isjust to code the specific mentions of a particular dataset, includingalternate names (e.g. abbreviations, etc.), rather than trying tocapture full text in which the data set is discussed.In total, a team of 5 coders, with a background in text analytics forpolicy research and computational linguistics, completed the task. Theresults were then used to re-render data_sets.json and thedata_set_citations.json file for the phase 1 train-test data toinclude mentions.This combined protocol and tool were developed in-house both because oftime considerations and because some of the off-the-shelf textannotators and Qualitative Analysis tools such as lighttag.io,tag.works, NVivo, Atlas.ti, MAXQDA did not handle distributed workflows.Methods and Fields——————For the task of detecting methods and fields for a given publication,our goals were broader than simply providing a vocabulary for each andasking the teams to classify publications against them. We want toencourage development of models that not only can figure out when agiven publication is a part of an existing field or uses an existingmethod, but that also understand enough about fields and methods suchthat they can be used to detect new fields and methods as they emerge,and can then be used to look back through time for traces of these newfields and methods to track their growth and evolution.We did not give any formal set of either methods or fields thatparticipants needed to train models to classify from. Instead, weprovided examples of taxonomies of methods and fields that SagePublications uses to classify their publications, and we directedparticipants to use them as an example, but to try to make models thatwould be more creative and potentially able to find new, emerging, ornovel fields rather than just fit a publication to a term from apredefined taxonomy. This decision to forego use of an existing taxonomyshowed the complexity of the problem of understanding fields and methodswell enough to detect them based on linguistic context. Some teamslimited themselves to the vocabularies we defined, and the results wereuninspiring. Some teams tried to detect based on text, but ended up witha lot of noise and few relevant terms.In addition, we also learned that there is complexity in “methods” thatlumping all methods together did not account for: methods could meanmany things, and we started to find sub-categories that we wish we hadbroken this into: statistical methods, analysis methods, data collectionand creation methods, etc.For future work, for each of these types of information, we intend tofirst work to decide what exactly we mean by “fields” and “methods”,then find or develop one or more taxonomies to precisely capture what wemean. Once we have these taxonomies, we’ll focus separately on buildingmodels to classify publications to them, and making models to extend andupdate them.Developing a submission process——————————-The submission process was designed to make it as straightforward andeasy as possible for a team to package their model for submission,including minimizing the understanding needed to use technologies chosenfor packaging and deployment and having a built-in way to automaticallyrun the model over the dev fold to validate processing of standard inputformats and creation of required output formats. We also wanted tominimize the installation and configuration work needed on part ofcompetition organizers to replicate computing environments as part ofmodel submission process and maximize our ability to see and be able totest how each submission environment is set up, and so avoid accepting ablackbox that could contain anything (including malicious code orsneaky/clever tricks). The git repository[^5] was integral to ourframework, but was not used directly by participants. Its coderepository was solely used as a home for the code, scripts, and filesthat made up our submission framework.Participants were instructed to work within the “project” folder intheir work folder, get their code working first on their local machine,then set up a docker container using the provided example files and getthe model running there, to isolate problems with docker from problemswith their model. Participants were allowed 2 test submissions beforethe final submission, and most groups took us up on those testsubmissions in phases 1 and 2. All groups were able to work within the“code.sh” and “project.py” files in “project” to get their model to run,so no further customizations were needed.Running a Submitted Model————————-Once a model was submitted, the competition organizers followed astandard script for running the model and processing its output foranalysis. Throughout this process, the evaluator communicated anyproblems with the participant team and worked with the team to addressproblems and turn around a new version of the model as quickly aspossible. If a team’s model performed poorly on the standard sizemachine, we also would sometimes try different sizes of server to givethem an idea of whether their problem was related to needing morecompute power, or was a limitation of their approach independent ofavailable resources.EvaluationIn both phases of the competition, we evaluated raw mentions, researchfields, and research methods separate from citation of named data sets.Phase 1 Evaluation——————### Mentions, Methods and FieldsIn phase 1, expert social science judges evaluated mentions, methods,and fields in two ways: 1) we randomly selected 10 publications tomanually examine each team’s output against, and made notes of good andbad for each team, then ranked the teams within each publication; and 2)we generated distributions of all values found across all publicationswithin each type of value, counted the occurrences of each, compared thedistributions across teams, and ranked the teams based on how theirdistributions compared. To create overall rankings, the judges met,compared notes and individual rankings, and then agreed on an overallranking of the teams.### Data Set CitationsTo evaluate data set citations in phase 1, we used the ICPSR citationdata as our evaluation baseline for creating a confusion matrix based onhow each team’s citation findings compared to ICPSR’s baseline, and wecalculated precision, recall, and F1 scores from the confusion matrix tocompare across teams. To create the confusion matrix for each team, westarted with a list of all of the data set-publication pairs foundeither in ICPSR’s baseline or the team’s output. We created found-or-not(1 or 0) vectors for every publication-data set pair for the baseline,and for the team. Then, for each data set-publication pair, we comparedthe values between the baseline vector and the team vector to decide howto update the confusion matrix for that pair: if a team agreed withICPSR on presence of a data set, that was counted as a true positive(TP). If the team found a data set that ICPSR did not, that was countedas a false positive (FP). If a team missed a data set ICPSR indicatedwas present, it was counted as a false negative (FN). We did not developa way to capture true negatives since the metrics we used to evaluatedid not require it. In addition, as part of the processing to create theoverall confusion matrix, we created per-publication confusion matricesfor each publication, so we could track average false positives andfalse negatives per publication, and highlight publications that werehigher than the average, for more detailed evaluation.We also deferred figuring out “mentioned” vs. “used in analysis” in ourinitial competition, to make the initial task more manageable. Thisdecision, combined with the traits of the ICPSR data, caused substantialnoise in the phase 1 precision/recall/F1 scores. For example, evenmodels that figured out that a longitudinal data set was presentsometimes got many false positives and false negatives because they gotthe years wrong, and models that correctly found ICPSR data sets used indiscussion had those counted as false positives because ICPSR had onlycaptured data sets used in analysis.Phase 2 Evaluation——————### Mentions, Methods and FieldsIn evaluating phase 2, we kept the division between mentions, fields,and methods and citations, but we refined our evaluation methods basedon what we’d learned in the first phase. We kept the basic strategy of:1) comparing the values created by each team’s model in the context of aset of selected publications and 2) reviewing the overall distributionsof values for each team.We expanded the number of publications across which we compared valuesto make the sample reviewed more representative, though, and created aweb-based tool to help judges deal with the added work from morepublications to review. We also selected publications differently fordata mentions from fields and methods, choosing publications withdifferent levels of agreement between the teams on whether data waspresent or not, to start to evaluate the different model’s ability todetect data at all, in addition to comparing the results when theythought a publication contained data.For fields and methods (and data set citations), we selected 20publications for each of our 6 topic areas of interest (Education,Health care, Agriculture, Finance, Criminal justice, and Welfare) with afew extras (2 extra in finance and 1 extra in criminal justice), for atotal of 123 publications to compare values across. Within the 20publications per topic area, we worked through a random selection ofarticles picking publications to add to our sample to fill out a roughratio within each topic area of 5:4:1 between publications with titleddata sets (5); data described, but not titled (4); and no data (1).To make it easier for the judges to work through this increased numberof publications, we also created a tool that collected the output foreach team side-by-side per publication along with a link to eachpublication’s PDF, and had a place for the judge to score each team’soutput for a given publication from among “–1”, “0”, and “1”. Oncejudges scored all output, we then created rankings based on the sum ofeach team’s scores.<img src="combined_images/chap05_figure2.png" alt="image1.png" style="width:6.5in;height:5in" />For manual evaluation of data set mentions, we used the same tooldescribed above, but we chose a different sample of 60 publicationsbased on agreement between the output of the different participant teammodels as to whether publications had data mentions. We then asked aseparate pair of qualitative judges to use the tool to compare andevaluate the data set mentions generated by the teams across thesepublications.### Data Set CitationsOur analysis of data set citations in phase 2 required a moresubstantial rethinking since we did not have any starting point forpresence or absence of data like the ICPSR corpus. We implemented amethod of creating a confusion matrix that could be used to generateprecision, recall, and F1 scores more closely aligned with the task we’dassigned the teams to implement - finding mentions of data and data setswithin publications.To implement this, we started with the sample of 123 publications usedfor evaluating mentions and fields above and:Captured all “data references” within each of those publications using anew human coding protocol. This included external titled data setseither discussed or used in analysis, external data without a title thatwas discussed or used in analysis, and data created by the researcherfor a given study.For each data reference, we compared all mentions and citations createdby each team for the publication to the information on the datareference within that publication and marked any that were “related” tothe data reference.Finally, we used the list of references as a baseline and built aconfusion matrix based on whether each team had found mentions orcitations “related” to each of the data references, along with a “falsepositive” record where the baseline was always 0 and the team wasassigned a 1 if they had one or more mentions or citations that were not“related” to any data reference.To capture data references in our sample of publications, we created abasic protocol for an initial round of data creation then evaluated theresults throughout the rest of the process. We used a single datareference coder to encourage consistency in output. We tried to capturedetailed context on each reference in order to make it easier forreviewers of this data to evaluate the quality of each data referenceand to give more context for judges deciding if mentions and citationsfor a given team were “related” to a given data reference.After the data references were captured, a team of coders then looked ateach data reference related to the selected publications for each teamto see if data set citations and mentions by the team were “related” tothe data reference. The coders, subject matter experts in the differentkey topic areas, looked at each “data reference” in publications intheir area of expertise. For each, they evaluated it against thementions and citations output by the model of each team that foundmentions or citations in the selected publication. For eachreference-team pair, the coder flagged any mentions or citations theydeemed “related to” the current data reference[^6].<img src="combined_images/chap05_figure3.png" alt="image3.png" style="width:6.5in;height:5in" />As onewould expect, while we got coders on the same page, each had subtlydifferent ideas about what was or was not “related to”. To remove someof this variability from our final data, we then had a sole experiencedresearcher who understood what we were trying to do review all codingand, when he saw coding that obviously did not fit his understanding,either: revise to fit his understanding of “related to”; or flag as onehe was unsure of and note his thoughts. This experienced researcher alsoserved as a final reviewer of the data references that were collected,marking any that did not actually refer to data as needing to be removedfrom our final analysis. Finally, the protocol designer reviewed allremoved data references, corrections, and ambiguities flagged foradditional review, and made a final set of corrections.Scoring the Results——————-To create a “related to” confusion matrix for each team, we started witha list of all of the data references that our final reviewers indicatedshould be included in our analysis (165 total). We created found-or-not(1 or 0) vectors with a value for every reference set to 1 for thebaseline, and then set based on our coding for each team. For eachpublication, we also included a false positive item that was always 0for the baseline, and that was set to 1 for a given team if they had anymentions or citations that were not “related to” a data reference fromthat publication.We did not develop a way to capture true negatives since the metrics weused to evaluate did not require it.Lessons learnedThe docker-based model submission process worked well for competition,but subsequent use of the models by Digital Science and Bundesbank hasshown that more precise design of how the models work within theirdocker container and the APIs they provide is necessary if packagedmodels are to be be used to produce reusable APIs. For example, to bereadily able to be used within an existing environment, the model needsto be able to be invoked from a simple unit of code (a python function,for example), rather than needing to spin up an instance of a containereach time you want results.To facilitate re-use, we need much more detailed specification of howthe participants should implement their models. For example:If a submission is implementing multiple tasks, each should be brokeninto its own separate API so it can be used separately (so separateservices for mention detection, field detection, and data detection).We need to better specify how we expect the models to be re-trained, inparticular elements of the model we expect to be easily changed andwhich we expect would require a full retraining to tune. For example, wehoped to be able to easily switch out the data sets of interest that aredetected specifically without needing to retrain on a full corpusreferring to those data sets, but we didn’t mention this, and none ofthe models worked this way.We also learned that that while the data for the competition was anexcellent starting point, it has some drawbacks. The base ICPSR data didnot include mention text. It only identified ICPSR data that were usedfor analysis. Hence, for the majority of data sets, the only textavailable for characterizing a data set was the title and a paragraph ofdescription with no examples of how the data would be discussed within apublication. A further drawback was that while data signatures ofinterest in the real world might just be clusters of key terms without aformal title, the competition data did not have that information.We consider the competition design to have been effective. We got a goodnumber of participants, the resulting models were interesting and someof the solutions were novel and surprisingly effective given theirnovelty, and discussions after the competition lead to collaborationsbetween pairs of sponsors and participants and collective work on makinga gold standard corpus that could be used to develop better models inthe future (a great step toward higher quality models). The models alsoended up being re-usable as they are, though in a limited scope, andBundesbank has been able to run them and get output of high enoughquality that it is useful to them.There remains substantial work needed to move this effort forward,however. The next iteration of the competition is tentatively scheduledto begin at the end of 2020, and in this round, we are exploring optionsfor building out a better corpus that combine manual, automated andcrowd-sourced means of annotating data. We are working on a morestandardized and carefully designed model packaging framework, tofacilitate re-use. We are also working on more detailed specificationsof model requirements (ability to retrain on data sets of interestwithout needing a whole new corpus of train-test data, for example).<em>Jonathan Morgan designed and implemented the data annotation andevaluation strategies and the first draft of our model packagingframework. Andrew Gordon sampled and prepared the corpus for processingand for distribution to participants. Ekaterina Levitskaya helped withthe design of refinement of coding protocols and did a substantialamount of the data annotation. Jonathan and Andrew worked together tocollect and run submissions for the competition and summarize the outputfor the judges.</em>[^1]: Soboroff, I. M., Ounis, I., Lin, J., &amp; Macdonald, C.

Allen with the goal of advancingartificial intelligence research for the common good. One of the majorundertakings at AI2 is to develop an equitable, unbiased softwareplatform (Semantic Scholar)[^1] for finding relevant information in thescientific literature. Semantic Scholar extracts meaningful structuresin a paper (e.g., images, entities, relationships) and links them toother artifacts when possible (e.g., knowledge bases, GitHubrepositories), hence our interest in the rich context competition (RCC).In particular, we participated in the RCC in order to explore methodsfor extracting and linking datasets used in papers. At the time of thiswriting, Semantic Scholar comprehensively covers the computer scienceand biomedical literature, and we plan to expand our coverage in 2019 toother scientific areas, including social sciences.In the following sections, we describe our approach to the three tasksof the RCC competition:1. extracting the datasets used in publications,2. predicting the field of research of publications3. extracting the methods used in publications<a href="#sec:methods">Methods</a>=======<a href="#sec:datasets_methods">Dataset Extraction and Linking</a>——————————This task focuses on identifying datasets used in a scientific paper.Datasets which are merely mentioned but not used in the research paperare not of interest. This task has two sub-tasks:1. Citation prediction: extraction and linking to a provided knowledge base of <em>known datasets</em>, and2. Mention prediction: extraction of both <em>known and unknown</em> dataset mentions.### Provided Data ###The provided knowledge base of known datasets includes approximately 10Kdatasets used in social science research. The high textual similarity betweendifferent datasets in the knowledge base informs our approach for linking datasetmentions to their dataset in the knowledge base. Approximately 10% of the datasets in theknowledge base were linked one or more times in the provided corpus of5K papers. To attempt to generalize mention discovery beyond those present in the knowledge base, we train a Named Entity Recognition model on the noisy annotations provided by the labeled mentions in the knowledge base.<img src="combined_images/datasets.png" alt="image" style="width:13cm" />We provide a high-level overview of our approach in Figure<a href="#fig:datasets" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:datasets">[fig:datasets]</a>. First, we use a named entity recognition(NER) model to predict dataset mentions. For each mention, we generate alist of candidate datasets from the knowledge base. We also developed arule based extraction system which searches for dataset mentions seen inthe training set, adding the corresponding dataset IDs in the trainingset annotations as candidates. We then use a binary classifier topredict which of these candidates is a correct dataset extraction.Next, we describe each of the sub-components in more detail.### Mention and Candidate Generation ###We first constructed a set of rule based candidate citations by exactstring matching mentions and dataset names from the provided knowledgebase. We found this to have high recall on the provided development foldand our own development fold that we created. However, after our testsubmission, it became clear that there were many datasets in the actualtest set that did not have mentions in the provided knowledge base.To address this limitation, we developed an NER model to predictadditional dataset mentions. For NER, we use a bi-LSTM model with a CRFdecoding layer, similar to <span class="citation" data-cites="Peters2018DEEPCW">[@Peters2018DEEPCW]</span>, and implemented usingthe AllenNLP framework.[^2] In order to train the NER model, weautomatically generate mention labels by string matching mentions in theprovided annotations against the full text of a paper. This results innoisy labeled data, because it was not possible to find all correctmentions this way (e.g., some dataset mentions were not annotated), andthe same string can appear multiple times in the paper, while only someare correct examples of dataset usage.We limit the percentage of negative examples (i.e., sentences with nomentions) used in training to 50%, and use 40 words as the maximumsentence length. We use 50-dimensional Glove word embeddings<span class="citation" data-cites="Pennington2014GloveGV">[@Pennington2014GloveGV]</span>, 16-dimensional character embeddings with 64CNN filters of sizes (2, 3, 4). The CNN character encoder outputs128-dimensional vectors. We optimize model parameters using ADAM<span class="citation" data-cites="Kingma2014AdamAM">[@Kingma2014AdamAM]</span> with a learning rate of 0.001.In order to generate linking candidates for the NER mentions, we scoreeach candidate dataset based on TF-IDF weighted token overlap between the mentiontext and the dataset title. For a given mention, many dataset titles canhave a non-zero overlap score, so we take the top 30 scoring candidatesfor each mention as the linking candidates for that mention.### Candidate Linking ###The linking model takes as input a dataset mention, its context, and oneof the candidate datasets in the knowledge base, and outputs a binarylabel. We use a gradient boosted trees classifier using the XGBoostimplementation.[^3] The model takes as input the following features: prior probability ofentity, prior probability of entity given mention, prior probability ofmention given entity, whether a year appears in the mention context andin the dataset title, mention length, mention sentence length, whetherthe mention is an acronym, estimated section title of the mention,overlap between mention context and dataset keywords provided in theknowledge base, and the TF-IDF weighted token overlap. We note that itis possible to predict zero, one or multiple dataset IDs for the samemention, and each dataset candidate is scored independently.<a href="#sec:areas_methods">Research Area Prediction</a>————————### Data ###The second task of the competition is to predict research areas of apaper. The task does not specify the set of research areas of interest,nor is training data provided for the task. After manual inspection of asubset of the papers in the provided test set, the SAGE taxonomy ofresearch, and the Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG) <span class="citation" data-cites="Shen2018AWS">[@Shen2018AWS]</span>, wedecided to use a subset of the fields of study in MAG as labels. Inparticular, we included all fields related to social science or papersfrom the provided training corpus. However, since the abstract and fulltext of papers are not provided in MAG, we only use the paper titles fortraining our model. The training data we ended up with includedapproximately 75K paper titles along with their fields of study asspecified in two levels of the MAG hierarchy. We held out about 10% ofthe titles for development data. The coarse level (L0) has 7 fieldswhile the more granular one (L1) has 32. Fields associated with lessthan 100 papers were excluded.### Methods ###For each level, we trained a bi-directional LSTM which reads the papertitle and predicts one of the fields in this level. We additionallyincorporate ELMo embeddings <span class="citation" data-cites="Peters2018DEEPCW">[@Peters2018DEEPCW]</span> to improve performance.In the final submission, we always predict the most likely field fromthe L0 classifier, and only report the most likely field from the L1classifier if it exceeds a certain threshold. It takes approximately 1.5and 3.5 hours for the L0 and L1 classifiers to converge, respectively.<a href="#sec:methods_methods">Research Method Extraction</a>————————–### Data ###The third task in the competition is to extract the scientific methodsused in the research paper. Since no training data was provided, westarted by inspecting a subset of the provided papers to get a betterunderstanding of what kind of methods are used in social science and howthey are referred to within papers.### Methods ###Based on the inspection, we designed regular expressions which capturecommon contextual patterns as well as the list of provided SAGE methods.In order to score candidates, we used a background corpus to estimatethe salience of candidate methods in a paper. Two additional strategieswere attempted but proved unsuccessful: a weakly-supervised model fornamed entity recognition, and using open information extraction (openIE)to further generalize the list of candidate methods.<a href="#sec:results">Results</a>============<a href="#sec:datasets_results">Dataset Extraction and Linking</a>——————————First, we report the results of our NER model in Table<a href="#tab:ner_results" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="tab:ner_results">[tab:ner_results]</a>. Since it is easy for the model to memorizethe dataset mentions seen at training time, we created disjoint train,development, and test sets based on the paper–dataset annotationsprovided for the competition. In particular, we sort datasets by thenumber of papers they appear in, then process one dataset at a time. Foreach dataset, we choose one of the train, development, or test splits atrandom and add the dataset to it, along with all papers which mention that dataset. When there is aconflict, (e.g., a paper <em>p</em> has already been added to thetrain split when processing an earlier dataset <em>d<sub>1</sub></em>, but it isalso associated with a later dataset <em>d<sub>2</sub></em>), the later dataset<em>d<sub>2</sub></em> along with all papers associated with it are added to thesame split as <em>d<sub>1</sub></em>. For any further conflicts, we prefer toput papers in the development split over the train split, and the testsplit over the development split.We also experimented with adding ELMo embeddings <span class="citation" data-cites="Peters2018DEEPCW">[@Peters2018DEEPCW]</span>,but it significantly slowed down training and decoding which would havedisqualified our submission due to the runtime requirements of thecompetition.

This is the performance after using thelinking classifier to predict which candidate mention–dataset pairs arecorrect extractions.

This performance is reflective of ourfocus on the linking component of this task. Aside from the competitiondevelopment set, we also used a random portion of the training set as anadditional development set. The initial model only uses a datasetfrequency feature, which gives a baseline performance of 38.4 F1. Addingp(d <span class="math inline">∣</span> m) and p(m <span class="math inline">∣</span> d), which are the probability of entitygiven mention and probability of mention given entity improves theperformance (<span class="math inline"><em>Δ</em> = 2.3</span> F1). Year matching helps disambiguatebetween different datasets in the same series, which was found to be amajor source of errors in earlier models (<span class="math inline"><em>Δ</em> = 2.8</span> F1).Aggregating mentions for a given dataset, adding mention and sentencelength features, adding an is acronym feature, and furtherhyper-parameter tuning improve the results (<span class="math inline"><em>Δ</em> = 12.5</span> F1). Addingexamples in the development set while training the model results infurther improvements (<span class="math inline"><em>Δ</em> = 2.8</span> F1). Finally, adding the NER-basedmentions significantly improves recall at the cost of lower precision,with a positive net effect on F1 score (<span class="math inline"><em>Δ</em> = 0.7</span> F1).Two clear limitations of our model are its difficulty in generalizing to unseen datasets, and its inability to effectively distinguish between datasets that are used in a publication and datasets that are merely reference. These limitations are the main causes of the low recall (due to difficulty generalizing to unseen datasets) and low precision (due to difficulty distinguishing between used datasets and referenced datasets).<a href="#sec:areas_results">Research Area Prediction</a>————————To select a model, we performed a 100 trial random search across modelhyper-parameters, evaluated on a held out development set of papers fromthe Microsoft Academic Graph. Our final model contained 512 hiddendimensions, 2 layers and 0.5 dropout prior to classification. The topperforming classifier achieved 84.4% accuracy on our development set onL0 fields, and 65.2% accuracy on our development set on L1 fields. The main limitation of using MAG for this problem is that our model cannot find new fields of research, and is limited to those provided by MAG. Additionally, our method performs classification based only on the titles of papers, while there are other pieces of information about the paper that would be useful for classifying the field of research.<a href="#sec:methods_results">Research Method Extraction</a>————————–We evaluated performance by manually evaluating the output of ourextractor for a subset of 50 papers from the provided test set tocompute precision. Since evaluating recall requires a carefulannotation, we resorted to using yield as an alternative metric. Ourfinal submission for method extraction has 95% precision and yield of1.5 methods per paper on the manually inspected subset of papers. Similarly to research area prediction, the main limiation here is the difficulty our model has finding new methods, as it is limited to the SAGE ontology and a few hand-crafted patterns.<a href="#sec:future_work">Future Work and Lessons Learned</a>============We now provide some possible directions of improvement for eachcomponent of our submission. For dataset extraction, the most promisingavenue of improvement is to improve the NER model, and the mostpromising avenue to improve the NER model is to collect less noisy data.We effectively have distantly supervised training data for the NERmodel, and the first thing to try would be directly annotating paperswith dataset mentions to provide a clearer signal for the NER model. Forresearch area prediction, it would help to include signals beyond justthe paper title for predicting the field of study. The difficulty hereis finding labeled training data that includes richer signals likeabstract text and paper keywords. For method prediction, exploringthe use of open information extraction is a potential avenueof future research. Additionally, it would be helpful to clarify whatexactly is meant by a method, as it is currently unclear what asuccessful method extraction looks like.The main lesson learned is that, when presented with noisy, distantly supervised, real-world data, to produce a production-quality system, it becomes very important to (1) have a high-confidence evaluation dataset, and (2) look for other data sources that are similar enough to the task at hand to be useful. Taking steps towards both of these objectives are promising avenues of future work.<a href="#sec:conclusion">Conclusion</a>==========This report summarizes the AI2 submission at the RCC competition. Weidentify dataset mentions by combining the predictions of an NER modeland a rule-based system, use TF-IDF to identify candidates for a givenmention, and use a gradient boosted trees classifier to predict a binarylabel for each candidate mention–dataset pair. To identify researchfields of a paper, we train two multi-class classifiers, one for each ofthe top two levels in the MAG hierarchy for fields of study. Finally, to extract research methods, weuse a rule-based system utilizing a dictionary and common patterns,followed by a scoring function which takes into account the prominenceof a candidate in foreground and background corpora.<a href="#sec:acknowledgements">Acknowledgments</a>===============We would like to thank the competition organizers for their tirelessefforts in preparing the data, answering all our questions, doing theevaluations, and providing feedback.

In other words, questions suitable for finding dataset names such as “What is the dataset used in this paper?,” are generated and the question answering model is trained to find the answers to those questions from the papers. Furthermore, the resulting answers from the model are filtered by types of each word. For example, if an answer contains words with organization or agency types, then this answer is likely to include the actual dataset names.For the research fields retrieval, we first crawled Wikipedia articles that correspond to the list of research fields. Then, we retrieved the research fields of the papers by measuring the similarity between the papers and the crawled Wikipedia documents. For example, we crawled the Wikipedia article “economic history” which corresponds to the research field “economic history.” If the similarity between a paper and the article “economic history” is high enough, it is determined that the paper belongs to a research field “economic history.” For the similarity measurement, the TF-IDF similarity is used, which is the similarity measurement based on the term frequency and document frequency.For the research methods retrieval, we train a model that recognizes named entities through a machine learning technique. More specifically, we considered the research methods as named entities and train a model to retrieve the named entities. For example, for a research method called “bivariate analysis”, this research method is considered as a named entity by the trained model and therefore, retrieved by the model.Literature Review=============Although <em>Information Retrieval</em> is a well-established research field, only a few attempts have focused on the task of dataset extraction form publications. <span class="citation" data-cites="ghavimi2016identifying">[@ghavimi2016identifying]</span> tried it using heuristics and dictionaries but their heuristics have some problems. Firstly, they give too much weight to acronyms. For example, <em>NYPD (New York Police Department)</em> is detected as a dataset name.Furthermore, they also give too much weight to the publication year of the datasets because they assumed dataset names are usually followed by the publication year but that may only work on Social Sciences publications. For example, Computer Science datasets do not appear followed by the publication year so this heuristic cannot detect all kind of dataset mentions.What did you do=============In this section, we will explain about the models we used for datasets retrieval, research fields retrieval, and research methods retrieval.Datasets Retrieval——————Our approach to solving the dataset retrieval task is reading comprehension (RC) with query generation and entity typing. An RC model is applied to the given publications with our own query generation module. Then, the result from the RC model is filtered with an entity typing module. Figure 1 shows our overall approach for dataset retrieval. In following subsections RC model, query generation, and entity typing are explained in detail.<img src="combined_images/docqaarch3.png" alt="image" /><em>Figure 1: Overall architecture for dataset retrieval</em>### Document QAReading comprehension models are neural networks that find answers for given queries according to a text. Answers must appear explicitly in the text. Since the dataset retrieval task is about finding explicit dataset mentions from publications, RC models are suitable for this task.The RC model used in this work is Document QA <span class="citation" data-cites="clark2017simple">[@clark2017simple]</span>. It uses Bi-GRU, bi-attention, and self-attention mechanism. In addition, Document QA performs a paragraph selection that pre-filters and selects the <em>k</em> most relevant paragraphs through TF-IDF similarity between the query and paragraphs. We observed that datasets are usually mentioned together in some specific paragraphs of the publications. Therefore, this model is appropriate for this task thanks to its paragraph selection stage.### Query generation moduleIn order to apply an RC model, such as Document QA, to the dataset retrieval task, queries that are suitable for finding the datasets are required. However, defining a general query for retrieving datasets is difficult, since the dataset mentions appear in various forms like surveys, datasets, or studies. Therefore, we devised a query generation module with some important query terms to generate multiple specific queries instead of one general query.To generate important query terms, we used a query generation model that creates queries given answers proposed by <span class="citation" data-cites="yuan2017machine">[@yuan2017machine]</span>. Thanks to this model, we could obtain a list of queries to retrieve datasets from the training set. After that, we extracted query terms that are frequent in the list of queries and at the same time are not frequent in non-dataset-mention sentences. Because of this, these query terms have discrimination power for retrieving dataset mentions since 1) queries are generated to extract mentions and 2) the query terms do not appear in the sentences without dataset mentions.This list of query terms is used to generate a general query concatenating query terms. This query is used for the paragraph selection stage of Document QA, as shown in Figure 1. After this stage, the query generation module generates queries for each paragraph by string matching, in order to create specific queries for each paragraph.### Ultra-Fine Entity TypingUltra-Fine Entity Typing <span class="citation" data-cites="Choi:2018:ACL">[@Choi:2018:ACL]</span> can predict a set of free-from phrases like <em>criminal</em> or <em>skyscraper</em> given a sentence with an entity mention. For example, in the sentence: <em>Bob robbed John and he was arrested shortly afterward</em>, Bob is of type <em>criminal</em>. In our task, candidate answers proposed by Document QA and their context are input to Ultra-Fine Entity Typing. Although this system can predict 10k different entity types in which <em>dataset</em> is included, after a few experiments we observed that most of the dataset names are recognized as some specific entity types such as <em>organization</em> and <em>agency</em>. Since these entity types are consistent, we decided that this could be a feature for our candidate answer classifier.### Candidate Answer ClassifierUsing the score given by the RC model for each candidate answer and the entity types given by Ultra-Fine Entity Typing for each candidate answer, a neural network classifier that filters the candidate answers of Document QA was used. We discovered that a candidate answer with a high score given by Document QA and whose entity type is <em>organization</em> or something similar is considerably likely to be a correct dataset name. Due to this pattern, we were able to create neural network classifier to filter out candidate answers.The classifier has the following architecture:1. Input size: 10332 (10331 labels from Ultra-Fine Entity Typing and the Document QA score)2. 1 hidden layer with 50 neurons3. Output size: 2The training set consists of 25172 examples and the test set of 6293 examples. Adam optimizer was used and cross entropy was used as loss function.Research Fields Retrieval————————-Our approach to obtaining the research fields is based on TF-IDF similarity with Wikipedia articles. First, a set of Wikipedia articles about different research fields using the library MediaWiki for Python was obtained. The list of research fields provided the Coleridge Initiative for the Rich Context Competition was used to crawl Wikipedia. This list has three levels of hierarchy as the example in Figure 2.<img src="combined_images/fieldshierarchy2.png" alt="Research fields hierarchy" /><em>Figure 2: Research fields hierarchy</em>The leaf nodes of that hierarchy were searched in Wikipedia to retrieve specific research fields instead of general ones. For example, we were aiming to retrieve <em>Neurosurgery</em> instead of <em>Medicine</em>.Then, using Scikit-learn <span class="citation" data-cites="scikit-learn">[@scikit-learn]</span>, a TF-IDF matrix of all the publications and Wikipedia articles of research fields were computed and the research field and all its superior nodes in the hierarchy associated with the most similar article were returned along with the similarity in the range [0,1]. The overall architecture can be seen in Figure 3.<img src="combined_images/researchfields2.png" alt="Overall architecture for research fields retrieval" /><em>Figure 3: Overall architecture for research fields retrieval</em>Research Methods Retrieval————————–For the research methods retrieval task, we modeled it as an named-entity recognition (NER) problem. Research methods are considered to be a named entities and because of this, they can be tagged as research method label (RS) instead of common NER labels such as: <em>location</em>, <em>people</em>, etc. Figure 4 shows the main architecture of the model proposed by <span class="citation" data-cites="lample2016neural">[@lample2016neural]</span> and used in this task.<img src="combined_images/bi-lstm.png" alt="BiLSTM-CRF architecture" /><em>Figure 4: Paragraph selection for DocQA in research method retrieval</em>The representation of a word using the model is obtained considering its context. We have the assumption that research methods have dependencies and constraints with words that appear in their surrounding context. Therefore, the conditional random field <span class="citation" data-cites="lafferty2001conditional">[@lafferty2001conditional]</span> layer in this model is suitable for detecting research methods by jointly tagging the whole sentence, instead of independently tagging each word.In this task, research method phrases which appeared in the training set were marked. Then, we represented the data in CoNLL 2003 format <span class="citation" data-cites="tjong2003introduction">[@tjong2003introduction]</span>, using IOB tag (Inside, Outside, Beginning). Every token is labeled as B-RS if the token is the beginning of a research method, I-RS if it is inside a research method but not the first token, or O if otherwise. We used this type of data to train the model which could detect research methods in publications.What worked and what didn’t===========================We tried different ideas to extract dataset names. Firstly, we tried to extract the dataset name using some hand-crafted queries in the QA model. But we noticed that these manually generated queries do not have sufficient discriminative power. Therefore, we tried to generate a general query with enough discriminative power to retrieve datasets names. To this end, we converted the sentences containing the dataset into queries, and then clustered the converted queries to get some generalized queries. However, we found that each of the resulting clusters did not reflect generalized queries. Hence, we had to create specific queries for each publication as explained in the previous section.We also tried to use the section names as a feature of the paragraph selection part in the Document QA. However, the use of section name has rather degraded the overall performance. In our analysis, this seems to be due to the noise that occurred when extracting the section name, since we relied on some heuristics to extract them.The use of entity typing worked well to remove the wrong candidate answers proposed by the reading comprehension model. Thanks to this filtering by entity types, we were able to improve the recall using the query generation module without sacrificing the precision.Our approach to retrieve research fields worked well as will be shown in the next section.Finally, our first idea to retrieve research methods was based on identifying their context words by using the frequency of those words. However, this approach did not achieve good results due to the lack of discriminative power of the most common words that co-occur with the research methods. Therefore, we tried to model it as an NER problem, where we consider each research method that appeared in a paper as a named-entity. By modeling the problem in this way, we can use existing NER models to extract research methods from papers. However, this approach also performed poorly.Summary of your results and caveats===================================Due to the difficulty of performing a quantitative analysis on a not extensively labeled dataset, a qualitative analysis was made. Several random publications were chosen and manually labeled by us to check the quality of our model and discover the strong and weak points.Datasets Retrieval——————To analyze the effects of the query generation module and entity typing module, we performed analyses on 100 phase 1 dev set with 3 different settings:1. Document QA only2. Document QA + query generation module3. Document QA + query generation module + entity typing module### Document QA onlyFigure 5 shows the results from 3 publications of phase 1 dev set with Document QA only. Compared to the other settings, Document QA only setting retrieves answers (dataset mentions) with high quality. However, the number of retrieved answers is notably small. For example, the result from <em>153.txt</em> publication was empty as in Figure 5. In fact, our model using this setting can retrieve only 260 answers (predictions) from 100 publications of phase 1 dev set.<img src="combined_images/phase1.png" alt="Results from Document QA only" /><em>Figure 5: Results from Document QA only</em>These results with fewer answers were expected, due to the difficulty of defining general queries as explained in section <a href="#query-generation-module"><em>Question Generation Module</em></a>. Without a query generation module, our query was not representative enough to retrieve various forms and types of the dataset mentions.### Document QA + query generation moduleFigure 6 shows the results from 3 publications of phase 1 dev set with Document QA and query generation module. Because of the latter, our dataset retrieval model could retrieve a large number of answers. For example, the result from <em>153.txt</em> publication contains a large number of answers with correct answers such as <em>financial services FDI data</em> or <em>Micro Database Direct investment</em>. Therefore, we believe that the query generation module improves recall of the entire dataset retrieval model. Actually, our model using this setting can retrieve more than 2,000 answers (predictions) from 100 publications of phase 1 dev set.However, compared to the Document QA only setting, there is a considerable number of noise. For example, in Figure 6, <em>empirical, Table 1, Section 4</em> and etc., are not dataset mentions.<img src="combined_images/phase1+querygen.png" alt="Results from Document QA + query generation module" /><em>Figure 6: Results from Document QA + query generation module</em>We believed that the reason of these noises is the several query terms potentially retrieve wrong answers. For example, we have a query term <em>"study"</em> to retrieve dataset mentions such as <em>"ANES 1952 Time Series Study"</em>. However, this term can also retrieve noises such as <em>"empirical study"</em>. These kinds of query terms are still needed to retrieve various forms and types of dataset mentions but clearly generate some noises.### Document QA + query generation module + entity typing moduleFigure 7 shows the results from 3 publications of phase 1 dev set with Document QA, query generation module, and entity typing module. Thanks to the entity typing module, we can see that most of the noises from the query generation module have disappeared. Although a few right answers such as <em>"FDI data"</em> was filtered out and a few wrong answers such as <em>"4.2.1 Micro Data"</em> was not, overall precision is adequately improved by entity typing module. In addition, our model in this setting could retrieve 526 answers (predictions) from 100 publications of phase 1 dev set.<img src="combined_images/phase1+querygen+entitytyping.png" alt="Results from Document QA + query generation module + entity typing module" /><em>Figure 7: Results from Document QA + query generation module + entity typing module</em>Research Fields Retrieval————————-We randomly selected 20 publications from the training set of phase 1, since our model does not require any training. The model was able to correctly predict 11. The strongest point is that the model is able to predict research fields which are significantly specific such as <em>Home health nursing management</em>. Among the weak points of the model, it has problems when two research fields are similar or share subtopics. Moreover, sometimes it fails due to the fact that it tries to retrieve excessively specific fields while more general ones would be suitable.Research Methods Retrieval————————–20 random publications were selected from the training set of phase 2 and labeled and our results are not as expected. The model is able to find proper research methods for 12 publications out of 20. For example, the model detects one of the research methods appeared in publication with id 15359 which is <em>Factor analysis</em>. However, the results contain a notable amount of noise. For example, the document with id 10751, the model retrieves several wrong answers like <em>Reviews describe</em>, <em>Composite materials</em>, <em>Detailed databases</em>, etc.Lessons learned and what would you do differently=================================================After the completion of this project, we realized that some steps could have been in a different way and led to better results. For example, we focused a lot on the model creation, however, we think that we should have spent more time on the analysis of the dataset to extract all its potential and search for additional datasets since some of the provided datasets contain noise.In addition, since Document QA is good for prototyping, it was a good idea to use it at the beginning to check that our hypothesis of modeling dataset retrieval as a QA task was right. However, at some point during the project, we should have changed it to another model with a state of the art performance.Also, in the QA model, we are currently using symbolic queries. But since we are generating our own queries, we could define and generate queries with a distributed representation. It would be more generic and model-matching queries. Furthermore, for research fields, we should have tried other ranking methods like BM25, a ranking function used by search engines whose performance is better than TF-IDF.Finally, for research methods, we should have analyzed more the dataset to use more suitable techniques like unsupervised NER instead of supervised NER.What comes next===============This work is the very first step of the Coleridge Initiative to build an “Amazon.com” for data users and data producers. The next step is to construct a system that recommends datasets to researchers. We have a hypothesis that datasets depend on research fields and vice versa. For example, in the research field <em>Question Answering</em>, a subfield of <em>Natural Language Processing</em> and <em>Computer Science</em>, the most commonly used dataset is SQuAD <span class="citation" data-cites="rajpurkar2016squad">[@rajpurkar2016squad]</span>. Therefore, according to our hypothesis, two publications using SQuAD are presumably to be in the same field, <em>Question Answering</em>. Based on this hypothesis, we intend to build hierarchical clusters of publications with the same research field. This way, a cluster will have publications with the same research field and similar datasets. As an example, the QA cluster will have papers about QA and those papers will use similar datasets like SQuAD and TriviaQA <span class="citation" data-cites="joshi2017triviaqa">[@joshi2017triviaqa]</span>. With these clusters, the system will be able to recommend datasets to data users. For example, if a publication is in the <em>Question Answering</em> field, the proposed system would be able to recommend the authors SQuAD and TriviaQA. Moreover, it would be able to recommend to data producers fields with a lack of datasets.In addition, we also need to improve the performance of the models we built. For example, since we used a pre-trained model in Document QA we think we could not exploit the whole potential of this system, so we would like to train our own model using a training set of publications.Acknowledgements================This work was supported by the Institute of Information &amp; Communications Technology Planning &amp; Evaluation (IITP) grant funded by the Korean Government (MSIT) (No. 2013-0-00179, Development of Core Technology for Context-aware Deep-Symbolic Hybrid Learning and Construction of Language Resources) and Next-Generation Information Computing Development Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Science, ICT (2017M3C4A7065962).Appendix: Description of the code and documentation====================================================The technical documentation of the code is provided in the GitHub repository of the project https://github.com/HaritzPuerto/RCC/tree/master/project—# Chapter 8 - GESISGESIS=====Authors: Wolfgang Otto, Andrea Zielinski, Behnam Ghavimim, Dimitar Dimitrov, Narges TavakolpoursalehIntroduction————Scientists and analysts often face the problem of finding interesting research datasets and identifying who else used the data, in which research fields, and how the data has been analyzed from a methodological perspective.- GESIS description- Why the competition is interesting for us?- One of gesis missions: Support Social Scientists in all steps of the research cycle.- Allready work in this area ((Boland et al., 2012))This chapter describe our approaches, techniques and used additional data used for our partitipation to the Rich Context Competition (RCC).### General Approach and Software ComponentsThe central tasks in the RCC is the extraction of dataset mentions from text. Nevertheless, we considered the discovery of research methods and research fields equally important. To this end, we decided to follow a module-based approach and developed tools that can be used separately but also as parts of a data processing pipeline. Figure [figure:pipeline] shows an overview of the software modules developed for the RCC competition, including their dependencies. Here, the upper three modules (gray) describe the pre-processing steps (cf. Section [sec:prepro]). The lower four modules (blue) are used to generate the output in a pre-specified format. The pre-processing step consists of extracting metadata and pure text from PDF documents. The extraction itself is done using the Cermine Tool[1] which returns a Journal Article Tag Suite<a href="Jats">2</a> XML document. Then, in a second step, text, metadata and references are extracted. The output of the pre-processing is then used by the software modules responsible for tackling the individual sub-tasks, i.e., discovering research datasets (cf. Section [sec:dataset-extraction]), methods (cf. Section [section:research_method_extraction]) and fields (cf. Section [section:field_classification]).<img src="figures/information-flow.png" alt="Software modules. The figure shows an overview of the individual software modules described in this document and their dependencies. Modules colored in gray represent our pre-processing pipeline, whereas blue-colored modules represent the three main tasks of the RCC." style="width:47.0%" />### First Phase FeedbackAfter the first phase, each team received feedback from the organizers of the RCC. The feedback is twofold and consists of a quantitative and qualitative evaluation. Unfortunately, our team did not perform very well regarding precision and recall. In contrast to this, our approach has been found convincing regarding the quality of results. The qualitative feedback result from a random sample of ten documents that are given to four judges. Judges are then asked to manually extract dataset mentions and calculate the overlap between their dataset extractions and the output of our algorithm. Other factors that judges took into consideration are specificity, uniqueness and multiple occurrences of dataset mentions. As for the extraction of research methods and fields no ground truth has been provided, these tasks were evaluated against the judges’ expert knowledge. Similarly to the extraction of dataset mentions, specificity and uniqueness have been considered for these two tasks. The feedback our team received acknowledged the fact that no ground truth has been provided and our efforts regarding the extraction of research methods and fields.Data and Pre-processing———————–This section describes the external data sources we used as well as our pre-processing steps.### External Data SourcesFor developing our algorithms, we also utilized two external data sources. For the discovery of research methods and fields, we resort to data from Social Science Open Access Repository[3] (SSOAR). SSOAR is maintained at GESIS – Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences collects and archives literature of relevance to the social sciences. In SSOAR, full texts are indexed using controlled social science vocabulary (Thesaurus[4], Classification[5]) and are assigned rich metadata. SSOAR offers documents in various languages. The corpus of English language publications that can be used for purposes of the competition consists of a total of 13,175 documents. All SSOAR documents can be accessed through the OAI-PMH[6] interface. Another external source that we used for discovery of research methods is the ACL Anthology Reference Corpus (Bird et al., 2008). ACL ARC is a corpus of scholarly publications about computational linguistics. The corpus consists of a total of 22,878 articles.### Pre-processingAlthough the organizers of the RCC, offered plain texts for the publication, we decided to build our own pre-process pipeline. The pipeline uses the Cermine Tool to extract information from PDF documents. The main benefit of using this tool is the structured metadata output including better disambiguation of sections and paragraphs in the publications. The output XML file uses the Journal Article Tag Suite[7]. For the competition, there are only two interesting elements of the Jats XML format, i.e., &lt;front&gt; and &lt;body&gt;. The &lt;front&gt; element contains the metadata of the publication, whereas the &lt;body&gt; contains the publication text. Another advantage of Cermine is that the hyphenation and segmentation of paragraphs are carried out automatically. As a last step of the pre-processing, we remove all linebreaks from the publication text and output a list of metadata fields and values as shown in Table [tab:example-paragraph] for each publication paragraph.| | Example Text Field Data ||:——————|:——————————–|| publication_id | 12744 || label | paragraph_text || text | A careful reading of text, word || | for word, was … || section_title | Data Analysis || annotations | [{’start’: 270, ’end’: 295, || | ’type’: ’bibref’, … || section_nr | [3, 2] || text_field_nr | 31 || para_in_section | 1 |[tab:example-paragraph]Dataset Extraction——————### Task DescriptionIn scientific literature, datasets are specified to indicate, e.g., the data on which a analysis is performed, a certain finding or a claim is based on. In this competition, we focus on (i) extracting and (ii) linking datasets mention from social science publications to a list of given dataset references. Identifying dataset mention in literature is a challenging problem due to the lack of an established style of citing datasets. Furthermore, in many research publication, a correct citation of datasets is entirely missing (Boland et al., 2012). The following two sentences exemplify the problem.<strong>Example 1</strong>: <em>P-values are reported for the one-tail paired t-test on </em>Allbus* (dataset mention) and <em>ISSP</em> (dataset mention).<em><strong>Example 2</strong>: </em>We used <em>WHO data from 2001</em> (dataset mention) to estimate the spreading degree of AIDS in Uganda.<em>We treat the problem of detecting dataset mentions in full-text as a Named Entity Recognition (NER) task.#### Formal problem definitionLet </em>D* denote a set of existing datasets <em>d</em> and the knowledgebase <em>K</em> as a set of known dataset references <em>k</em>. Furthermore, each element of <em>K</em> is referencing an existing dataset <em>d</em>. The Named Entity Recognition and linking task is defined as (i) the identification of dataset mentions <em>m</em> in a sentence, where <em>m</em> references a dataset <em>d</em> and (ii) linking them, when possible, to one element in <em>K</em> (i.e., the reference dataset list given by the RCC).### ChallengesWith our method, we focus on the extraction of dataset mentions in the body of the full-text of scientific publications. We recognize three types a dataset can be mentioned: (i) The full name of a dataset like ”National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey“, (ii) an abbreviation (”NHaNES“) or (iii) a vague reference, e.g.,”the monthly statistic“. By each of these varieties, the NER task faces particular challenges. For the first type, the used dataset name can vary in different publications. Where one publication cites the dataset with”National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey“ the other could use the words ”Health and Nutrition Survey“. In a case where abbreviations are used a disambiguation problem occurs, e.g., in”WHO data“. WHO may describe the World Health Organization or the White House Office. The biggest challenge is again the lack of a precise gold standard that can be used to train a classifier. In the following we describe how we have dealt with this lack of ground truth data.### Phase one approachThe challenge of missing ground truth data is the main problem to handle during this competition. To this end, supervised learning methods for dataset mentions extraction from text are not directly applicable. To overcome this limitation, we resort to the provided list of dataset mentions and publication pairs and re-annotate the particular sentences in the publication text. This re-annotation is then used to train Spacy’s neural network based NER model[8]. We created a holdout set of 1000 publications and a training set of size 4000. We train our model using publication paragraphs as training samples. In the training set, 0.45 percent of the paragraphs contained mentions. For each positive training example, we added a negative example that does not contain dataset mentions and is sampled at random. We used a batch size of 25 and a dropout rate of 0.4. The model was trained for 300 iterations.#### EvaluationWe evaluated our model with respect to four metrics: strict precision and recall, and partial precision and recall. While the former are standard evaluation metrics, the latter are their relaxed variants in which the degree to which dataset mentions have to match can vary. Consider the following example of a partial match: “National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey” is the extracted dataset mention whereas, “National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)” represents the true dataset mention.| Metric | Value ||:——————|:—–:|| Partial Precision | 0.93 || Partial Recall | 0.95 || Strict Precision | 0.80 || Strict Recall | 0.81 |[table:dataset-mention-eval]Table [table:dataset-mention-eval] show the results of the dataset mention extraction on the holdout set. The model is able to achieve high strict precision and recall values. As expected, the results are even better for the partial version of the metrics. But, this version indicates that even if we are not able to exactly match the dataset mention in text, we can find the right context with very high precision at least.### Phase two approachIn the second phase of the competition additional 5,000 publications have been provided. We extended our approach to consider the list with dataset names supplied by the organizers and re-annotated the complete corpus of 15.000 publication in the same manner as in phase one to obtain training data. This time we split the data in 80% for training and 20% for test.#### EvaluationWe resort to the same evaluation metrics as in phase one. However, we calculate precision and recall on the full-text of the publication and not on the paragraphs as in the first phase. Table [table:dataset-mention-eval-phase-two] show the results achieved by our model. We observe a lower precision and recall values. Compared to phase one, there is also a smaller difference between the precision an recall values for the strict and partial version of the metrics.| Metric | Value ||:——————|:—–:|| Partial Precision | 0.51 || Partial Recall | 0.90 || Strict Precision | 0.49 || Strict Recall | 0.87 |[table:dataset-mention-eval-phase-two]Research Method Extraction————————–### Task DescriptionInspired by a recent work of Nasar et al. (Nasar et al., 2018), we define a list of basic entity types that give key-insights into scholarly publications. We adapted the list of semantic entity types to the domain of the social sciences with a focus on <em>research methods</em>, but also including related entity types such as <em>Theory, Model, Measurement, Tool, Performance</em>. We suspect that the division into semantic types might be helpful to find <em>research methods</em>, because related semantic entities types might provide clues or might be directly related to the research method itself. For instance, in order to realize a certain research objective, an experiment is instrumented where a specific combination of <em>methods</em> is applied to a <em>data set</em> that might be intellectual or <em>software</em>, thus achieving a specific <em>performance</em> and result in that context.<strong>Example</strong>: <em>P-values</em> (measurement) are reported for the <em>one-tail paired t-test</em> (method) on <em>Allbus</em> (dataset) and <em>ISSP</em> (dataset).#### Formal problem definitionLet <em>E</em> denote a set of entities. The Named Entity Recognition and Linking task consists of (i) identifying entity mentions <em>m</em> in a sentence and, (ii) linking them, when possible, to a reference knowledge base <em>K</em> (i.e, the SAGE Thesaurus[9]) and (iii) assigning a type to the entity, e.g., <em>research method</em>, selected from a set of given types. Given a textual named entity mention <em>m</em> along with the unstructured text in which it appears, the goal is to produce a mapping from the mention <em>m</em> to its referent real world entity <em>e</em> in <em>K</em>.### ChallengesThere are some major challenges that any named entity recognition, classification and linking system needs to handle. First, regarding NER, identifying the entities boundary is important, thus detecting the exact sequence span. Second, ambiguity errors might arise in classification. For instance,‘range’ might be a domain-specific term from the knowledge base or belong to the general domain vocabulary. This is a challenging task for which context information is required. In the literature, this relates to the problem of <strong>domain adaptation</strong> which includes fine-tuning to specific named entity classes[10]. With respect to entity linking, another challenge is detecting name variations, since entities can be referred to in many different ways. Semantically similar words, synonyms or related words, which might be lexically or syntactically different, are often not listed in the knowledge base (e.g., the lack of certain terms like ‘questioning’ but not ‘questionnaire’). This problem of automatically detecting these relationships is generally known as <strong>linking problem</strong>. Note that part of this problem also results from PDF-to-text conversion which is error-prone. Dealing with incomplete knowledge bases, i.e. <strong>handling of out of vocabulary (OOV) items</strong>, is also a major issue, since knowledge bases are often not exhaustive enough and do not cover specific terms or novel concepts from recent research. Last but not least, the combination of different semantic types gives a more coherent picture of a research article. We hypothesize that such information would be helpful and results in an insightful co-occurrence statistics, and provides additional detail directly related to entity resolution, and finally helps to assess the <strong>relevance of terms</strong> by means of a score.### Our Approach - OverviewOur context-aware framework builds on Stanford’s CoreNLP and Named Entity Recognition System[11]. The information extraction process follows the workflow depicted in Figure [figure:pipeline], using separate modules for pre-processing, classification, linking and term filtering.We envision the task of finding entities in scientific publications as a sequence labeling problem, where each input word is classified as being of a dedicated semantic type or not. In order to handle entities related to our domain, we train a novel machine learning classifier with major semantic classes, using training material from the ACL RD-TEC 2.0 dataset (QasemiZadeh and Schumann, 2016). Apart from this, we follow a domain adaptation approach inspired by (Agerri and Rigau, 2016) and ingest semantic background knowledge extracted from external scientific corpora, in particular the ACL Anthology (Bird et al., 2008; Gildea et al., 2018). We perform entity linking by means of a new gazetteer-based SAGE dictionary of Social Research Methods (Lewis-Beck et al., 2003), thus putting a special emphasis on the social sciences. The linking component addresses the synonymy problem and matches an entity despite name variations such as spelling variations. Finally, term filtering is carried out based on a termhood and unithood, while scoring is achieved by calculating a relevance score based on TF-IDF (cf. Section [para:relscore]).Our research experiments are based on the repository for the Social Sciences SSOAR as well as the train and test data of the Rich Context Competition corpus[12]. Our work extends previous work on this topic (cf. (Eckle-Kohler et al., 2013)) in various ways: First, we do not limit our study to abstracts, but use the entire fulltext. Second, we focus on a broader range of semantic classes, i.e. <em>Research Method</em>, <em>Research Theory</em>, <em>Research Tool</em> and <em>Research Measurement</em>, tackling also the problem of identifying novel entities.[pipeline] <img src="combined_images/pipeline.png" title="fig:" alt="Overview of the entity extraction pipeline" style="width:47.0%" />#### Distributed Semantic ModelsFor domain adaptation, we integrate further background knowledge. We use vector embeddings of words trained on additional corpora and which serve as input features to the CRF model. Semantic representations of words are a successful extension of common features, resulting in higher NER performance (Turian et al., 2010) and can be trained offline.In this work, the word vectors were learned from the scientific ACL ARC[13] using Gensim with the skip gram model (cf. (Mikolov et al., 2013)) and a pre-clustering algorithm[14]. A summary of the size of the unlabeled English data used for training word embeddings can be found in Table [tab:UnlabeledData].| Corpus | Articles | Documents/Tokens ||:———–|:———|:—————–|| ACL Corpus | 22,878 | 806,791/2.5 GB |#### FeaturesThe features incorporated into the linear chain CRF are shown in the Table [tab:features]. The features depend mainly on the observations and on pairs of adjacent labels, using a log-linear combination. However, since simple token level training of CRFs leads to poor performance, more effective text features such as word shape, orthographic, gazetteer, Part-Of-Speech (POS) tags, along with word clustering (see Section [subsec:dist-model]) have been used.| <strong>Type</strong> | <strong>Features</strong> ||:————————-|:——————————————————————————————————————:|| <strong>Token unigrams</strong> | <em>w</em><sub><em>i</em> − 2</sub>, <em>w</em><sub><em>i</em> − 1</sub>, <em>w</em><sub><em>i</em></sub>, <em>w</em><sub><em>i</em> + 1</sub>, <em>w</em><sub><em>i</em> + 2</sub>, … || <strong>POS unigrams</strong> | <em>p</em><sub><em>i</em></sub>, <em>p</em><sub><em>i</em> − 1</sub>, <em>p</em><sub><em>i</em> − 2</sub> || <strong>Shapes</strong> | shape and capitalization || <strong>NE-Tag</strong> | <em>t</em><sub><em>i</em> − 1</sub>, <em>t</em><sub><em>i</em> − 2</sub> || <strong>WordPair</strong> | (<em>p</em><sub><em>i</em></sub>, <em>w</em><sub><em>i</em></sub>, <em>c</em><sub><em>i</em></sub>) || <strong>WordTag</strong> | (<em>w</em><sub><em>i</em></sub>, <em>c</em><sub><em>i</em></sub>) || <strong>Gazetteer</strong> | SAGE gazetteer || <strong>Distributional Model</strong> | ACL Anthology model |#### Knowledge ResourcesWe use the SAGE thesaurus which includes well-defined concepts, an explicit taxonomic hierarchy between concepts as well as labels that specify synonyms of the same concept. A portion of terms is unique to the social science domain (e.g., ‘dependent interviewing’), while others are drawn from related disciplines such as statistics (e.g., ‘conditional likelihood ratio test’)[15]. However, since the thesaurus is not exhaustive and covers only the top-level concepts related to social science methods, our aim was to extend it by automatically extracting further terms from domain-specific texts, in particular from the Social Science Open Access Repository. More concretely, we carried out the following steps to extend SAGE as an off-line step. For step 2 and 3, candidate terms have been extracted by our pipeline for the entire SSOAR corpus.1. Assignment of semantic types to concepts (manual)2. Extracting terms variants such as abbreviations, synonyms, related terms from SSOAR (semi-automatic)3. Computation of Term and Document Frequency Scores for SSOAR (automatic)#### Extracting term variants such as abbreviations, synonyms, and related terms26.082 candidate terms have been recognized and classified by our pipeline and manually inspected to a) find synonyms and related words that could be linked to SAGE, and b) build a post-filter for incorrectly classified terms. Moreover, abbreviations have been extracted using the algorithm of Schwartz and Hearst (Schwartz and Hearst, 2003). This way, a Named Entity gazetteer could be built and will be used at run-time. It comprises 1,111 terms from SAGE and 447 terms from the Statistics glossary as well as 54 previously unseen terms detected by the model-based classifier.#### Computation of Term and Document Frequency ScoresTerm frequency statistics have been calculated off-line for the entire SSOAR corpus. The term frequency at corpus level will be used at run time to determine the term relevance at the document level by calculating the TF-IDF scores. The most relevant terms from SAGE are listed in Table [tab:SAGET].| [tab:SAGET] <strong>SAGE Term</strong> | <strong>TF-IDF Score</strong> | <strong>Semantic Class</strong> ||:—————————-|:—————–|:——————-|| Fuzzy logic | 591,29 | Research Method || arts-based research | 547,21 | Research Method || cognitive interviewing | 521,13 | Research Method || QCA | 463,13 | Research Method || oral history | 399,68 | Research Method || market research | 345,37 | Research Field || life events | 186,61 | Research Field || Realism | 314,34 | Research Theory || Marxism | 206,77 | Research Theory || ATLAS.ti | 544,51 | Research Tool || GIS | 486,01 | Research Tool || SPSS | 136,52 | Research Tool |#### Definition of a Relevance ScoreRelevance of terminology is often assessed using the notion of <em>unithood</em>, i.e. ‘the degree of strength or stability of syntagmatic combinations of collections’, and <em>termhood</em>, i.e. ‘the degree that a linguistic unit is related to domain-specific concepts’ (Kageura and Umino, 1996). Regarding <em>unithood</em>, the NER model implicitly contains heuristics about legal POS tag sequences for candidate terms, consisting of at least one noun (NN), preceeded or followed by modifiers such as adjectives (JJ), participles (VB*) or cardinal numbers (CD), complemented by wordshape features.In order to find out if the candidate term also fulfills the <em>termhood</em> requirement, domain-specific term frequency statistics have been computed on the SSOAR repository, and set in contrast to general domain vocabulary terms. It has to be noted that only a small portion of the social science terms is actually unique to the domain (e.g., ‘dependent interviewing’), while others might be drawn from related disciplines such as statistics (e.g., ‘conditional likelihood ratio test’).#### Preliminary ResultsOur method has been tested on 100 fulltext papers from SSOAR and 10 documents from the Rich Context Competition (RCC), all randomly selected from hold out corpora. In our experiments on SSOAR Social Science publications, we compared results to the given metadata information. The main finding was that while most entities from the SAGE thesaurus could be extracted and linked reliably (e.g., ’Paired t-test’), they could not be easily mapped to the SSOAR metadata terms, which consist of only a few abstract classes (e.g., ’quantitative analysis’). Furthermore, our tool was tested by the RCC organizer, were the judges reviewed 10 random publications and generated qualitative scores for each document.Research Field Classification—————————–### Task DescriptionThe goal of this task is to identify the research fields covered in social science publications. The RCC data does not provide a gold standard —annotated training data— for that task. To this end, we decided to train a classifier using annotated data from SSOAR. In this way, our interpretation of the task is to select one or more labels from a given set of labels for each publication. This approach is known as a mulit-label classification. In our case, a label represents a research field.### Our approach - OverviewDue to the unequal distribution of labels in the dataset, we need to guaranty enough training data for each label. We selected only labels with frequency over 300 for training the model which results in a total of 44 labels representing research fields. We decided to train a classification model based on the fasttext framework (Joulin et al., 2017). To train our model we resort to the abstracts of the publication, as this approach worked better than using the full-texts.### EvaluationFigure [fig:results_fasttext] shows the performance of the model regarding various evaluation metrics for different thresholds. A label is assigned to a publication if the model outputs a probability for the label above the defined threshold. In multi-label classification, this allows us to evaluate our model from different perspectives.<img src="combined_images/fast-text-evaluation.png" alt="Precision-Recall vs. Threshold" style="width:49.0%" />Acknowledgments—————We would like to thank GESIS for giving us the time and resources to participate in the competition.References———-Agerri R and Rigau G (2016) Robust multilingual named entity recognition with shallow semi-supervised features. <em>Artificial Intelligence</em> 238.

In particular, tracking the datasets used, topics addressed, experiments performed and results achieved by peers becomes increasingly tedious. Current academic search engines render a limited number of entries pertaining to this information. However, having this knowledge would be beneficial for researchers to become acquainted with all results and baselines relevant to the problems they aim to address. With our participation in the NYU Coleridge Initiative’s Rich Context Competition, we aimed to provide approaches to automate the discovery of datasets, research fields and methods used in publications in the domain of Social Sciences. We trained an Entity Extraction model based on Conditional Random Fields and combined it with the results from a Simple Dataset Mention Search to detect datasets in an article. For the identification of Fields and Methods, we used word embeddings. In this paper, we present how our approaches performed, their limitations, some of the encountered challenges and our future agenda.author:- Rricha Jalota- Nikit Srivastava- Daniel Vollmers- René Speck- Michael Röder- Ricardo Usbeck- ‘Axel-Cyrille <span>Ngonga Ngomo</span>’bibliography:- ’references.bib’title: | DICE @ Rich Context Competition 2018 – Combining Embeddings and Conditional Random Fields for Research Dataset, Field and Method Recognition and Linking—Literature Review=================Previous works on information retrieval from scientific articles aremainly seen in the field of Bio-medical Sciences and Computer Science,with systems <span class="citation" data-cites="DBLP:journals/ploscb/WestergaardSTJB18">[@DBLP:journals/ploscb/WestergaardSTJB18]</span> built using theMEDLINE[^1] abstracts, full-text articles from PubMed Central[^2] or ACLAnthology dataset[^3]. The documents belonging to the above-mentioneddatasets follow a similar format, and thus, several metadata andbibliographical extraction frameworks like CERMINE <span class="citation" data-cites="tkaczyk2014cermine">[@tkaczyk2014cermine]</span>have been built on them. However, since articles belonging to the domainof Social Sciences do not follow a standard format, extracting keysections and metadata using already existing frameworks likeGROBID <span class="citation" data-cites="lopez2009grobid">[@lopez2009grobid]</span>, ScienceParse[^4] orParsCit <span class="citation" data-cites="councill2008parscit">[@councill2008parscit]</span> did not seem as viable options, majorlybecause these systems were still under development and lacked certaindesired features. Hence, building upon the approach of Westergaard et.al <span class="citation" data-cites="DBLP:journals/ploscb/WestergaardSTJB18">[@DBLP:journals/ploscb/WestergaardSTJB18]</span>, we built our ownsections-extraction framework for dataset detection and research fieldsand methods identification.Apart from content and metadata extraction, keyphrase or topicextraction from scientific articles has been another emerging researchproblem in the domain of information retrieval from scientific articles.Gupta et al. <span class="citation" data-cites="gupta2011analyzing">[@gupta2011analyzing]</span> devised a method, based on applyingsemantic extraction patterns to the dependency trees of sentences in anarticle’s abstract, for characterizing a research work in terms of itsfocus, application domain and techniques used. Mahata etal. <span class="citation" data-cites="mahata2018key2vec">[@mahata2018key2vec]</span> proposed an approach to process text documentsfor training phrase embeddings in order to thematically representscientific articles and for ranking the extracted keyphrases. Jansen etal. <span class="citation" data-cites="jansen2016extracting">[@jansen2016extracting]</span> extracted core claims from scientificarticles by first detecting keywords and keyphrases using rule-based,statistical, machine learning and domain-specific approaches and thenapplying document summarization techniques.The problem of dataset detection and methods and fields identificationis not only somewhat different from the ones mentioned above, but alsoour approach for tackling it is radically disparate. The followingsections describe our approach in detail.Project Architecture====================<embed src="combined_images/flowchart_paper.pdf" />Our pipeline (shown in Figure [fig:flowchart]) consisted of three maincomponents: 1) Preprocessing, 2) Fields and Methods Identification and3) Dataset Extraction. The Preprocessing module read the text frompublications and generated some additional files (seeSection [preprocess] for details). These files along with the givenFields and Methods vocabularies were used to infer Research Fields andMethods from the publications. Then, the information regarding fieldswas passed onto the Dataset Detection module and using the DatasetVocabulary, it identified Dataset Citations and Mentions. The followingsections provide a detailed overview of each of these components.Preprocessing=============The publications were provided in two formats: PDF and text. ForPhase-1, we used the given text files, however during Phase-2, we cameacross many articles in the training files that had not been properlyconverted to text and contained mostly non-ASCII characters. To workwith such articles, we relied on the open source tool <code>pdf2text</code> from<code>poppler suite</code>[^5] to extract text from PDFs. The <code>pdf2text</code> commandserved as the first preprocessing step and was called as a subprocessfrom within a python script. It was used with <code>-nopgbrk</code> argument togenerate the text files.Once we had the text files, we followed the rule-based approach asproposed by Westergaard et al. <span class="citation" data-cites="DBLP:journals/ploscb/WestergaardSTJB18">[@DBLP:journals/ploscb/WestergaardSTJB18]</span>for pre-processing. The following series of operations based mostly onregular expressions were performed:- Words split by hyphens were de-hyphenated- Irrelevant data was removed (i.e., equations, tables, acknowledgment, references);- Main sections (i.e., abstract, keywords, JEL-Classification, methodology/data, summary, conclusion) were identified and extracted;- Noun phrases from these sections were extracted (using the python library, spaCy[^6]).We came up with the heuristics for identifying the main sections aftergoing through the articles from different domains in the training data.We collected the surface forms for the headings of all major sections(abstract, keywords, introduction, data, approach, summary, discussion)and applied regular expressions to search for them and separate themfrom one another. The headings and their corresponding content werestored as key-value pairs in a file. For generating noun-phrases, thisfile was parsed and for all the values (content) in key-value(heading-content) pairs, a spaCy object <code>doc</code> was created sentence-wise.Using the built-in function for extracting noun chunks<span><code>doc.noun_chunks</code></span>, we generated key-value pairs of heading andnoun-phrases found in the content and stored them in another file, whichwe later used for fields and methods identification.If a section was not found in the article (because of no explicitmention), then only the sections that could be detected were extracted.The remaining content was saved as <code>reduced_content</code> after cleaning andnoun-phrases were extracted from them to prevent loss of any meaningfuldata. Table [tab:sections] shows the number of identified sections invalidation data. For brevity, we have evaluated only four main sections:title, abstract, keywords and methodology/data, since these are the onesgetting preferential treatment in methods and fields identification.<span>C<span>4cm</span> C<span>3.5cm</span> C<span>4cm</span></span> <strong>Sections</strong> &amp; <strong>No explicit mention</strong>&amp; <strong>Mentioned but not found</strong> Title &amp; 0 &amp; 0 Keywords &amp; 13 &amp; 2 Abstract &amp; 0 &amp; 1 Methodology/Data &amp; 18 &amp; 4 We used <code>pdfinfo</code> from zhe <code>poppler suite</code> to extract PDF metadata thatvery often contained the keywords and subject of an article. This toolwas helpful in those cases where the keywords were not found by theregular expression. In the end, the preprocessing module generated four text files for apublication: PDF-converted text, PDF-metadata, processed articlescontaining relevant data, and noun phrases from the relevant sections,respectively. These files were then passed on to the other twocomponents of the pipeline, which have been discussed below.Approach========Research Fields and Methods Identification——————————————### Vocabulary Generation and Model Preperation1. <strong>Research Methods Vocabulary</strong>: In Phase-1 of the challenge, we used the given methods vocabulary. However, the feedback that we received from Phase-1 evaluation gave more emphasis to statistical methods used by the authors, references to the time scope, unit of observation, and regression equations rather than the means used to compile the data, i.e., surveys. Since the given methods vocabulary was not a complete representation of statistical methods and also consisted terms depicting surveys, in Phase-2, we decided to create our own Research Methods Vocabulary using Wikipedia and DBpedia.[^7] We manually curated a list of all the relevant statistical methods from Wikipedia[^8] and fetched their descriptions from the corresponding DBpedia resources. For each label in the vocabulary, we extracted noun phrases from its description and added them to the vocabulary. For examples, please refer Table [tab:vocab]. <span>C<span>1.5cm</span> C<span>5cm</span> C<span>5cm</span></span> <strong>Label</strong> &amp; <strong>Description</strong> &amp; <strong>Noun Phrases from Description</strong> Political forecasting &amp; Political forecasting aims at predicting the outcome of elections. &amp; Political forecasting, the outcome, elections Nested sampling algorithm &amp; The nested sampling algorithm is a computational approach to the problem of comparing models in Bayesian statistics, developed in 2004 by physicist John Skilling. &amp; algorithm, a computational approach, the problem, comparing models, Bayesian statistics, physicist John Skilling 2. <strong>Research Fields Vocabulary</strong>: For both the phases, we used the given research fields vocabulary and, just like the methods vocabulary, added noun phrases from the description of the labels to it. However, since our phase-1 model seemed to confuse fields with methods, for Phase-2, we additionally created a blacklist of terms that didn’t contain any domain-specific information, such as; Mixed Methods, Meta Analysis, Narrative Analysis and the like.3. <strong>Word2Vec Model generation</strong>: In this pre-processing step, we used the above-mentioned vocabulary files containing noun phrases to generate a vector model for both research fields and methods. The vector model was generated by using the labels and noun phrases from the description of the available research fields and methods to form a sum vector. The sum vector was basically the sum of all the vectors of the words present in a particular noun phrase. 3em <span>The pre-trained Word2Vec model <code>GoogleNews-vectors-negative300.bin</code> <span class="citation" data-cites="DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1301-3781">[@DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1301-3781]</span> was used to extract the vectors of the individual words.</span>4. <strong>Research Method training results creation</strong>: For research methods, we generated an intermediate result file for the publications present in the training data. It was generated using a <code>naïve finder algorithm</code> which, for each publication, selected the research method with the highest cosine similarity to any of its noun phrase’s vectors. This file was later used to assign weights to research methods using Inverse Document Frequency.### Processing with Trained Models- <strong>Finding Research Fields and Methods:</strong> To find the research fields and methods for a given list of publications, we performed the following steps: (At first, Step 1 was executed for all the publications, thereafter Step 2 and 3 were executed iteratively for each publication). 1. <strong>Naïve Research Method Finder run</strong> - In this step, we executed the <code>naïve research method finding algorithm</code> (i.e. selected a research method based on the highest cosine similarity between vectors) against all the current publications and then merged the results with the existing result from the <code>research methods’ preprocessing step</code>. The combined result was then used to generate IDF weight values for each <code>research method</code>, to compute the significance of recurring terms. 2. <strong>IDF-based Research Method Selection</strong> - We re-ran the algorithm to find the closest research method to each noun phrase and then sorted the pairs based on their weighted cosine similarity. The weights were taken from the IDF values generated in the first step and the manual weights assigned (section-wise weighting). Here, the noun phrases that came from the methodology section and from the methods listed in JEL-classification (if present) were given a higher preference. The pair with the highest weighted cosine similarity was then chosen as the Research Method of the article. 3. <strong>Research Field Finder run</strong> - In this step, we first found the closest research field from each noun phrase in the publication. Then we selected the Top N (= 10) pairs that had the highest weighted cosine similarity. Afterwards, the noun phrases that had a similarity score less than a given threshold (= 0.9) were filtered out. The end-result was then passed on to a post-processing algorithm. For weighted cosine similarity, the weights were assigned manually based on the section of publication from which the noun phrases came. In general, noun phrases from title and keywords (if present) were given a higher preference than other sections, since usually these two sections hold the crux of an article. Note, if sections could not be discerned from an article, then noun phrases from the section, reduced_content (see section [preprocess]), were used to find both fields and methods. 4. <strong>Research Field Selection</strong> - The top-ranked term from the result of step 3, which was not present in the blacklist of irrelevant terms, was marked as the research field of the article.Dataset Extraction——————For identifying the datasets in a publication, we followed twoapproaches and later combined results from both. Both the approacheshave been described below.1. <strong>Simple Dataset Mention Search:</strong> We chose the dataset citations from the given Dataset Vocabulary that occurred for one dataset only and used these unique mentions to search for the corresponding datasets using regular expressions in the text documents. Then, we computed a frequency distribution of the datasets. As can be seen from Figure [fig:graph], certain dataset citations occurred more often than others. This is because while searching for dataset citations, apart from the dataset title, the corresponding mention_list from Dataset Vocabulary was also considered, which contained many commonly occurring terms like ‘time’, ‘series’, ‘time series’, ‘population’ etc. Therefore, we filtered out those dataset citations that occurred more than a certain threshold value (=1.20) multiplied by the median of the frequency distribution and had less than 3 distinct mentions in a publication. The remaining citations were written to an interim result file. Table [tab:simple] depicts the improvement in performance of Simple Dataset Mention Search with the inclusion of filtering. The filtering process improved the F1-measure by 42.86%. Note, as the validation data consisted of only 100 articles, changing the threshold value to 1.10 or 1.30 didn’t result in any significant change, hence we have maintained a constant threshold value of 1.20 in our comparison table. <span>C<span>1.5cm</span> C<span>3.5cm</span> C<span>3.5cm</span> C<span>3.5cm</span></span> <strong>Metrics</strong> &amp; <strong>without filtering</strong> &amp; <strong>Threshold=1.20, mentions <span class="math inline">&lt;</span> 3</strong> &amp; <strong>Threshold=1.20, mentions <span class="math inline">&lt;</span> 4</strong> Precision &amp; 0.09 &amp; 0.71 &amp; 0.09 Recall &amp; 0.28 &amp; 0.12 &amp; 0.28 F1-score &amp; 0.14 &amp; <strong>0.20</strong> &amp; 0.14 <embed src="combined_images/freq.pdf" />2. <strong>Rasa-based Dataset Detection:</strong> In our second approach, we trained an entity extraction model based on conditional random fields using Rasa NLU <span class="citation" data-cites="DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1712-05181">[@DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1712-05181]</span>. For training the model we used the Spacy Tokenizer[^9] for the preprocessing step. For Entity Recognition we used BILOU tagging and used 50 iterations to train the CRF. We used the Part of Speech tags, the case of the input tokens and the suffixes of the tokens as input features for the CRF model. We particularly tested two configurations for training the CRF-based NER model. In Phase-1, the 2500 labeled publications from the training dataset were used for training the Rasa NLU[^10] model. Later in Phase-2, when the Phase-1 holdout corpus was released, we combined its 5000 labeled publications with the previously given 2500 labeled publications and then retrained the model again with these 7500 labeled publications. <strong>Running the CRF-Model:</strong> The trained model was run against the preprocessed data to detect dataset citations and mentions. Only the entities that had a confidence score greater than a certain threshold value (= 0.72) were considered as dataset mentions. A dataset mention was considered as a citation only if it was found in the given Dataset Vocabulary (via string matching either with a dataset title or any of the terms in a dataset ‘mention_list’) and if it belonged to the research field of the article. To check if a dataset belonged to the field of research, we found the cosine similarity of the terms in the ‘subjects’ field of the Dataset Vocabulary with the keywords and the identified Research Field of the article.3. <strong>Combining the two approaches:</strong> The output generated by the Rasa-based approach was first checked for irrelevant citations before a union was performed to combine the results. This was done by checking if a given dataset_id occured more than a threshold value (= 1.20) multiplied by the median of the frequency distribution (same as the filtering process of the Simple Dataset Mention Search).Note that, the threshold values mentioned above were set after someexperiments of trial and testing. For dataset extraction, the goal wasto keep the number of false positives low while not compromising thetrue positives. For research methods and fields, a manual evaluation(see the next section for details) was done to test if the results madesense with the articles.Evaluation==========We performed a quantitative evaluation for Dataset Extraction using theevaluation script provided by the competition organizers. Thisevaluation (see Table [tab:dataset]) was carried out against thevalidation data, wherein we compared four different configurations. Ascan be inferred from the table, there was only a slight increase inperformance for the Rasa-based model, when the training samples wereincreased. However, combining it with the Simple Dataset Mention Search,increased the performance by <em>19.42%</em>. Interestingly, there was noimprovement in performance in the combined approach even when thetraining samples for the Rasa-based model were increased. This might bebecause of the removal of frequently-occuring terms from theRasa-generated output, based on the frequency distribution of datasetmentions as computed in the Simple Dataset Mention Search. <span>M<span>2.2cm</span> | M<span>2.3cm</span> | M<span>2.2cm</span> M<span>2.2cm</span> M<span>2.2cm</span></span> &amp; &amp; <strong>Metrics</strong>&amp; <strong>Rasa-based Approach</strong> (2500) &amp; <strong>Rasa-based Approach</strong>(7500) &amp; <strong>Combined Approach</strong> (2500) &amp; <strong>Combined Approach</strong> (7500) <strong>Precision</strong> &amp; 0.382 &amp; 0.388 &amp; <strong>0.456</strong> &amp; <strong>0.456</strong> <strong>Recall</strong> &amp; 0.26 &amp; 0.26 &amp; <strong>0.31</strong> &amp; <strong>0.31</strong> <strong>F1</strong> &amp; 0.309 &amp; 0.311 &amp; <strong>0.369</strong> &amp; <strong>0.369</strong> For Research Fields and Methods, we carried out a qualitative evaluationagainst 10 randomly selected articles from Phase-1 holdout corpus.Tables [tab:field] and [tab:method] depict a comparison between thepredicted fields and methods in Phase-1 and Phase-2. In general, ourmodels returned a more granular output in the second phase, solelybecause of the modifications we made in the vocabularies.<span>C<span>1cm</span> C<span>4.5cm</span> C<span>3cm</span> C<span>3.5cm</span></span> <strong>pubid</strong> &amp; <strong>Keywords</strong> &amp;<strong>Phase-1</strong> &amp; <strong>Phase-2</strong> 10328 &amp; Cycling for transport, leisure and sport cyclists &amp; Healthevaluation &amp; <strong>Public health and health promotion</strong> 7270 &amp; Older adult drug users, harm reduction &amp; Health Education &amp;<strong>Correctional health care</strong> 6053 &amp; Economic conditions - crime relationship, homicide &amp; Homicide &amp;<strong>Gangs and crime</strong> <span>C<span>1cm</span> C<span>4.5cm</span> C<span>3cm</span> C<span>3.5cm</span></span> <strong>pubid</strong> &amp; <strong>Keywords</strong> &amp;<strong>Phase-1</strong> &amp; <strong>Phase-2</strong> 10328 &amp; Thematic content analysis &amp; Thematic analysis &amp; <strong>Sidakcorrection</strong> 7270 &amp; Interviews conducted face to face, finding systematic patterns orrelationships among categories identified by reading the interviewtranscript &amp; Qualitative interviewing &amp; <strong>Sampling design</strong> 6053 &amp; Autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) time-seriesmodel &amp; Methodological pluralism &amp; <strong>Multivariate statistics</strong> Discussion==========Throughout the course of this competition, we encountered severalchallenges and limitations in all the three stages of the pipeline. Inthe preprocessing step, the appropriate extraction of text from PDFsturned out to be rather challenging. This was especially due to thevaried formats of the publications, which made the extraction ofspecific sections—that contained all data relevant to ourwork—demanding. As mentioned before, if there was no explicit mention ofthe key-terms like<code>Abstract, Keywords, Introduction, Methodology/Data, Summary, Conclusion</code>in the text, then the content was saved as ‘reduced_content’ afterapplying all other preprocessing steps and filtering out any irrelevantdata. Our experiments suggest that the labeled publications we received fordataset detection were not uniform in the dataset mentions provided,which made it difficult to train an entity extraction model even with anincreased number of training samples. Hence, there was only a slightimprovement in performance when the Rasa-model was trained with 7500publications instead of 2500. This was also why we combined theRasa-based approach with the Simple Dataset Mention Search, so that atleast the datasets that were present in the vocabulary didn’t getmissed.Regarding the fields and methods, vocabularies played an immense role intheir identification. The vocabularies that were provided by the SAGEpublications contained some terms that were either polysemous or veryhigh-level and therefore, were picked up by our model very often. Hence,for research methods, we created our own vocabulary containing all therelevant statistical methods, and for fields, we introduced a blacklistof irrelevant terms and looked it up each time, before writing theresult to the output file. The goal of blacklist generation was tofilter the terms that did not carry domain-specific information andsounded more like research methods than fields. Since the focus was onmore granulated results, we tried to look for open ontologies for SocialScience Fields and Methods and unfortunately, could not find any. It isworth mentioning that since our approach for Fields and Methodsidentification relied heavily upon vocabularies, it could not find anynew methods or fields from the publications.Based on the final evaluation feedback, since our Phase-2 models did notperform as good as we expected, following are a few things that we couldhave done differently.1. For research methods, merging the given SAGE methods vocabulary with our manually curated vocabulary, could have resulted in methods that would have been both granular and statistical while still being relevant to the publications. Introducing a blacklist just as we did for research field identification, could also have been another workaround.2. For both fields and methods identification, we could have also tried pre-trained embeddings from glove[^11] and fastText[^12].3. As our entity-extraction approach for Dataset Detection suffered from a limitation of inconsistent labels (i.e. datasets mentioned in the form of abbreviation, full-name, collection procedure, and keywords) in training data, we could have extended the Simple Dataset Mention Search to a pattern-oriented search based on handcrafted rules derived from sentence structure and other heuristics.Future Agenda=============The data provided to us in the competition displayed a cornucopia ofinconsistencies even after human processing. We hence propose thatmachine-aided methods for computing correct and complete structuredrepresentation of publications are of central importance for scientificresearch such as an Open Research KnowledgeGraph <span class="citation" data-cites="DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1901-10816">[@DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1901-10816]</span><span class="citation" data-cites="DBLP:conf/esws/BuscaldiDMOR19">[@DBLP:conf/esws/BuscaldiDMOR19]</span>.Previous works on never-ending learning have shown how humans andextraction algorithms can work together to achieve high-precision andhigh-recall knowledge extraction from unstructured sources. In ourfuture work, we hence aim to populate a <strong>scientific knowledge graphs</strong>based on never-ending learning. The methodology we plan to develop willbe domain-independent and rely on active learning to classify, extract,link and publish scientific research artifacts extracted fromopen-access papers. Inconsistency will be remedied by ontology-basedchecks learned from other publications such as SHACL constraints whichcan be manually or automatically added.[^13] The resulting graphs will- rely on advanced distributed storage for RDF to scale to the large number of publications available;- be self-feeding, i.e., crawl the web for potentially relevant content and make this content available for processing;- be self-repairing, i.e., be able to update previous extraction results based on insights gathered from new content;- be weakly supervised by humans, who would assist in correcting wrong hypotheses;- provide standardized access via W3C Standards such as SPARQL.Having such knowledge graphs would make it easier for the researchers(both young and veteran) to easily follow along with their domain offast-paced research and eliminate the need to manually update thedomain-specific ontologies for fields, methods and other metadata as newresearch innovations come up.Appendix========The code and documentation for all our submissions can be found here:<a href="https://github.com/dice-group/rich-context-competition" class="uri">https://github.com/dice-group/rich-context-competition</a>.[^1]: <a href="https://www.nlm.nih.gov/bsd/medline.html" class="uri">https://www.nlm.nih.gov/bsd/medline.html</a>[^2]: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/" class="uri">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/</a>[^3]: <a href="https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/" class="uri">https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/</a>[^4]: <a href="https://github.com/allenai/science-parse" class="uri">https://github.com/allenai/science-parse</a>[^5]: [poppler]<a href="https://manpages.debian.org/testing/poppler-utils" class="uri">https://manpages.debian.org/testing/poppler-utils</a>[^6]: <a href="https://github.com/explosion/spaCy" class="uri">https://github.com/explosion/spaCy</a>[^7]: <a href="https://wiki.dbpedia.org/services-resources/ontology" class="uri">https://wiki.dbpedia.org/services-resources/ontology</a>[^8]: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Statistical_methods" class="uri">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Statistical_methods</a>[^9]: https://spacy.io/api/tokenizer[^10]: <a href="https://rasa.com/docs/nlu" class="uri">https://rasa.com/docs/nlu</a>[^11]: <a href="https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove" class="uri">https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove</a>[^12]: <a href="https://fasttext.cc/docs/en/crawl-vectors.html" class="uri">https://fasttext.cc/docs/en/crawl-vectors.html</a>[^13]: <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/" class="uri">https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/</a>—# Chapter 10 - Singapore<!-----author:- |    Philips Kokoh Prasetyo, Amila Silva, Ee-Peng Lim, Palakorn Achananuparp      Living Analytics Research Centre      Singapore Management University      [{pprasetyo,amilasilva,eplim,palakorna}@smu.edu.sg]{}bibliography:- 'rcc-02.bib'title: Simple Extraction for Social Science Publications----->## Chapter: Simple Extraction for Social Science PublicationsPhilips Kokoh Prasetyo, Amila Silva, Ee-Peng Lim, Palakorn Achananuparp Living Analytics Research Centre, Singapore Management University {pprasetyo,amilasilva,eplim,palakorna}<span class="citation" data-cites="smu.edu.sgFirst">@smu.edu.sgFirst</span> draft: 11 February 2019; Second draft: 12 June 2019### AbstractWith the vast number of datasets and literature collections available for research today, it is very difficult to keep track on the use of datasets and literature articles for scientific research and discovery. Many datasets and research work using them are left undiscovered and under-utilized due to the lack of available search tools to automatically find out who worked with the data, on what research topics, using what research methods and generating what results. The Coleridge Rich Context Competition (RCC) therefore aims to build automated dataset discovery tools for analyzing and searching social science research publications. In this chapter, we describe our approach to solving the first phase of Coleridge Rich Context Competition.### Table of contents1. <a href="#1-introduction">Introduction</a>2. <a href="#2-related-work">Related Work</a>3. <a href="#3-data-analysis">Data Analysis</a>4. <a href="#4-methods">Methods</a>5. <a href="#5-experiment-results">Experiment Results</a>6. <a href="#6-conclusion">Lesson Learned</a>7. <a href="#7-acknowledgements">Acknowledgement</a>8. <a href="#appendix-technical-documentation">Appendix: Technical Documentation</a>### 1. IntroductionAutomated discovery from scientific research publications is an important task for analysts, researchers, and learners as they develop the scientific knowledge and use them to gain new insights. More specifically, on the tasks of discovering datasets and methods mentioned in a research publication, we have seen a lack of available tools to easily find who else worked on a particular dataset, what research methods people apply on the dataset, and what results they have found using the dataset. Furthermore, new datasets are not easy to discover, and as a result, good datasets and methods are often neglected.The Coleridge Rich Context Competition (RCC) aims to build automated datasets discovery from social science research publications, filling the gap of this problem. In this competition, given a corpus of social science research publications, we have to automatically identify datasets used, and then infer the research methods and research fields in the publications. Note that no labeled data are given for research methods and fields identification.We describes our submission to the first phase of RCC. We perform dataset detection followed by implicit entity linking approach to tackle dataset extraction task. We adopt weakly supervised classification for research methods and fields identification tasks utilizing external resource SAGE Knowledge as proxy for weak labels.<!-- This manuscript describes summary of our submission for the first phaseof RCC.

Related WorkExtracting information from scientific text has been explored in the past [<a href="#PM04">PM04</a>; <a href="#NCKL15">NCKL15</a>; <a href="#SBP+16">SBP<sup>+</sup>16</a>]. One type of information extraction from scientific articles is extracting keyphrases and relation between them [<a href="#ADR+17">ADR<sup>+</sup>17</a>]. Luan et al. (2017) propose semi-supervised sequence tagging approach to extract keyphrases [<a href="#LOH17">LOH17</a>]. Augenstein and Søgaard (2017) explore multi-task deep recurrent neural network approach with several auxiliary tasks to extract keyphrases [<a href="#AS17">AS17</a>].Another type of extraction is citation extraction. Two citation extraction settings have been explored before: reference mining inside the full text [<a href="#ACK18">ACK18</a>], and citation metadata extraction [<a href="#Het08">Het08</a>; <a href="#APBM14">APBM14</a>; <a href="#AGJ+17">AGJ<sup>+</sup>17</a>]. Nasar er al. (2018) write a survey on information extraction from scientific articles [<a href="#NJM18">NJM18</a>].Recently, there are some work to explore dataset extraction fromscientific text [<a href="#BREM12">BREM12</a>; <a href="#GML+16">GML<sup>+</sup>16</a>; <a href="#GMVL16">GMVL16</a>].

Dataset extraction is a challenging task because of the inconsistency and wide range of dataset mention styles in research publications [<a href="#GMVL16">GMVL16</a>].### 3. Data AnalysisThe first phase of RCC dataset consists of a labeled corpus of 5,000 publications for training set, and additional 100 publications for development set. The RCC organizer keeps a separate corpus of 5,000 publications for evaluation. Each article in the dataset contains full text article and dataset citation labels. The metadata of cited datasets in the corpus are also provided. For research methods and fields, no label information is provided, only SAGE social science research method graph and research fields vocabulary are provided.<strong>Preprocessing.</strong> In order to reliably access important structures of paper publications, we parse all papers using AllenAI Science Parse<a href="https://github.com/allenai/science-parse"><sup>1</sup></a> [<a href="#AGB+18">AGB<sup>+</sup>18</a>]. AllenAI Science Parse reads PDF file, and returns title, authors, abstract, sections, and bibliography (references). Since this parser utilizes machine learning models to parse PDF file, the parsing results may not be 100% accurate. Furthermore, this parser is unable to parse scan copy of old publication. In the situation where we are unable to access parsed fields, we fall back to the given text files.<strong>Mention Analysis.</strong> There are 5,499 and 123 dataset citations in training and development set respectively. Among these citations, 320 citations in training set and 6 citations in development set do not have mentions information. We analyze the paper sections where the dataset mentions commonly occur. Table <a href="#user-content-tab_train_top_sections">1</a> and <a href="#user-content-tab_dev_top_sections">2</a> show top 12 most common sections mentioning dataset in training and development set. The tables suggest that abstract, reference titles, discussion, results, and methods are the most common sections where the dataset mentions occur. We exploit reference titles for dataset extraction.<a name="tab_train_top_sections">Table 1</a>: Top 12 Sections Mentioning Datasets in Training SetSection Header | Mention Frequency————– | —————–:Abstract | 2,548Reference Titles | 1,997Discussion | 1,390Results | 836Methods | 804Introduction | 530Statistical Analysis | 285Comment | 279Acknowledgements | 261Materials and Methods | 254Study Population | 227Data | 214<a name="tab_dev_top_sections">Table 2</a>: Top 12 Sections Mentioning Datasets in Development SetSection Header | Mention Frequency————– | —————–:Abstract | 78Reference Titles | 37Discussion | 19Introduction | 14Results | 12Statistical Analyses | 9Methods | 8Ethics | 7Population | 7Population Impact | 7Price | 72.1 Data | 5<strong>Citation Analysis.</strong> We build citation network from training set.

However, based on table <a href="#user-content-tab_network_stats">3</a>, we learn that exploring rich context using paper-paper citation network is not viable at this stage because most papers listed in publications’ bibliography are not available in the training set, and therefore, paper-paper citation network becomes very sparse with many unknown information. Due to this reason, we drop our idea on utilizing paper-paper citation graph at this stage. Nevertheless, we believe that bibliography contains important signals and information about datasets, and research fields.### 4. MethodsIn this section, we describe our approach for RCC tasks: dataset extraction, research methods identification, and research fields identification.#### Dataset ExtractionWe employ a pipeline of two subtasks for dataset extraction: dataset detection, followed by dataset recognition. The goal of dataset detection is to detect whether a publication cites a dataset or not. This first subtask helps us to quickly filter out non-dataset publications. After the first subtask, we mine dataset mentions for the remaining publications in dataset recognition subtask.For dataset detection, we utilize paper title in bibliography (reference list) combined with explicit research methods mentions to detect whether a publication citing a dataset or not. Explicit research methods mentions are determined based on exact match between paper title and SAGE research methods vocabulary. We train an SVM classifier using explicit research method mentions and n-gram features from paper titles in bibliography. We use the SVM classifier to classify each publication, if the classifier gives positive label, then we proceed to dataset recognition subtask, otherwise we ignore the publication.For dataset recognition, we use an implicit entity linking approach. We start with the Naive Bayes model, which can be regarded as a standard information retrieval baseline, and entity indicative weighting strategy is used to improve the model. In order to calculate the word distribution of each dataset, we represent each dataset using its title, dataset mentions (provided in the training set), and dataset relevant sentences, filtered from the relevant publications using the rule based approach proposed in [<a href="#GMVL16">GMVL16</a>]. All these text sections related to a particular dataset are considered as a single text chunk, and we calculate the word distribution as follows. Let <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?$\textbf{w}$" title="$\textbf{w}$" /> be the set of words in a dataset. In our problem setting, we assume the dataset prior probability <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?p(d)" title="p(d)" /> to be uniform. The probability of dataset <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?d" title="d" /> given <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?$$w$&space;\in&space;\textbf{w}$" title="$$w$ \in \textbf{w}$" /> is:<!-- $$\begin{split}    p(d|\textbf{w}) & \propto \prod _{w \in \textbf{w}} p(w|d) \\    & = \prod _{w \in \textbf{w}} \frac{f(d,w) + \gamma }{ \sum_{w'} f(d,w') + |W| \gamma}\end{split}$$ --><a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\begin{align*}&space;p(d|\textbf{w})&space;&&space;\propto&space;\prod&space;_{w&space;\in&space;\textbf{w}}&space;p(w|d)&space;\\&space;&&space;=&space;\prod&space;_{w&space;\in&space;\textbf{w}}&space;\frac{f(d,w)&space;&plus;&space;\gamma&space;}{&space;\sum_{w'}&space;f(d,w')&space;&plus;&space;|W|&space;\gamma}&space;\end{align*}" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\begin{align*}&space;p(d|\textbf{w})&space;&&space;\propto&space;\prod&space;_{w&space;\in&space;\textbf{w}}&space;p(w|d)&space;\\&space;&&space;=&space;\prod&space;_{w&space;\in&space;\textbf{w}}&space;\frac{f(d,w)&space;&plus;&space;\gamma&space;}{&space;\sum_{w'}&space;f(d,w')&space;&plus;&space;|W|&space;\gamma}&space;\end{align*}" title="\begin{align*} p(d|\textbf{w}) & \propto \prod _{w \in \textbf{w}} p(w|d) \\ & = \prod _{w \in \textbf{w}} \frac{f(d,w) + \gamma }{ \sum_{w'} f(d,w') + |W| \gamma} \end{align*}" /></a>where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?f(d,&space;w)" title="f(d, w)" /> is the number of co-occurrences of word <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?w" title="w" /> with entity <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?d" title="d" />, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\gamma" title="\gamma" /> is the smoothing parameter, and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?|W|" title="|W|" /> is the vocabulary size. For each dataset <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?d" title="d" />, we derive <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?f(d,&space;w)" title="f(d, w)" /> by the count of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?w" title="w" /> occurrences in the text extracted for each dataset. In order to stress more priority for dataset indicative words, we improved the final objective function of our model as follows:<!-- $$ln(p(d|\textbf{w})) \propto \sum _{w \in \textbf{w}} \beta(w) * ln(p(w|d))$$ --><a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=$$ln(p(d|\textbf{w}))&space;\propto&space;\sum&space;_{w&space;\in&space;\textbf{w}}&space;\beta(w)&space;*&space;ln(p(w|d))$$" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?$$ln(p(d|\textbf{w}))&space;\propto&space;\sum&space;_{w&space;\in&space;\textbf{w}}&space;\beta(w)&space;*&space;ln(p(w|d))$$" title="$$ln(p(d|\textbf{w})) \propto \sum _{w \in \textbf{w}} \beta(w) * ln(p(w|d))$$" /></a>where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\beta(w)" title="\beta(w)" /> is the entity-indicative weight for word <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?w" title="w" />. This weight <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\beta(w)" title="\beta(w)" /> is added as an exponent to the term <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?p(w|d)" title="p(w|d)" />. <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\beta(w)" title="\beta(w)" /> is calculated as:<!-- $$\beta(w) = log(1 + E / df(w))$$ --><a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=$$\beta(w)&space;=&space;log(1&space;&plus;&space;E&space;/&space;df(w))$$" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?$$\beta(w)&space;=&space;log(1&space;&plus;&space;E&space;/&space;df(w))$$" title="$$\beta(w) = log(1 + E / df(w))$$" /></a>where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?E" title="E" /> is the number of distinct datasets considered and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?df(w)" title="df(w)" /> counts the number of datasets with at least one occurrence of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?w" title="w" />.Then for a given unseen publication, we use same rule based approach [<a href="#GMVL16">GMVL16</a>] to filter a few relevant sentences, and datasets are ranked by <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?ln(p(d|w))" title="ln(p(d|w))" /> to select the most suitable datasets. In order to select exact datasets related to particular publication, we select top 10 datasets ranked using above approach. And then the confidence probability related to the top 10 datasets are normalized and select the datasets with the normalized probability higher than a predefined threshold value. We return the entity indicative words as relevant dataset mentions.#### Research Methods IdentificationSince we do not have labeled training data for this task, we use explicit research method mentions (based on exact match with SAGE research methods vocabulary) in a publication as weak signals on research methods used in the publication. When these mentions frequently appear in a publication, there is a high chance that this publication is using these particular research methods.Based on this intuition, we generate training set for research method classification utilizing sentences that explicitly mention research method in a publication. Publication title and the sentences mentioning research method serve as context information of a specific research method. In order to reduce noisy weak signals, we apply minimum support of three sentences in a publication. We exclude research methods which only being mentioned one or two times in a publication. We also exclude research methods that only being mentioned in less than 10 different publications from the training set. Finally, we have 133 research methods having sufficient context information for training data. This number is 20.18% of 659 research methods in SAGE research method graph.We use the training data to train logistic regression classifier to classify research methods from publication title and sentences. We utilize n-gram features from publication title and sentences for the classifier. We apply the logistic regression classifier to recommend top 3 research methods based on logistic regression probability score.This approach can be extended by utilizing research method graph to expand the context. Context information does not only comes from sentences in publication, but also comes from related research methods as well as broader concept information. By using this information, we can potentially expand to more than 133 research methods and perform more accurate prediction.#### Research Fields IdentificationSimilar to research methods identification, this task does not have labeled training data. We only have access to list of SAGE research fields. SAGE research fields are organized hierarchically into three levels, namely L1, L2, and L3, for example: Soc-2-4 (<em>kinship</em>) is under Soc (<em>sociology</em>) in L1, and under Soc-2 (<em>anthropology</em>) in L2.To gain more understanding about the characteristic of each field, we crawl top search results from SAGE Knowledge<a href="http://sk.sagepub.com/browse/"><sup>2</sup></a>. From the search result snippets, we collect information such as title and abstract on various publications including case, major work, books, handbooks, and dictionary. We exclude video and encyclopedia. Due to sparseness of the SAGE Knowledge, we exclude all research fields with less than 10 search results. In the end, we have samples of 414 L3 research fields under 101 L2 research fields and 10 L1 research fields. This numbers cover 20.87% of 1,984 L3 research fields, and 67.79% of 149 L2 research fields in the list of SAGE research fields. We use this data to train research fields classifiers.We build three SVM classifiers for L1, L2, and L3 to classify a publication using paper title and abstract. Instead of taking the highest score, we take top-k research fields and perform re-ranking considering agreement among L1, L2, L3. We return a research field if its upper level are also in top ranks. Since level L1 is too general, we only output research fields from L2, and L3. We outline our heuristic to reorder the ranking below:1. Get top-5 L3 research fields, top-4 L2 research fields, and top-3 L1 research fields.2. Assign initial score <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?v" title="v" /> for each research field based on its ranking. <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=v(f_i)&space;=&space;(K&space;-&space;i)&space;/&space;K" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?v(f_i)&space;=&space;(K&space;-&space;i)&space;/&space;K" title="v(f_i) = (K - i) / K" /></a> where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?K" title="K" /> is the length of top-k, and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?i" title="i" /> is the ranking of a research field <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?f" title="f" />. For example, research fields in top-5 L3 have initial score of <code>[1, 0.8, 0.6, 0.4, 0.2]</code>, top-4 L2 have initial score of <code>[1, 0.75, 0.5, 0.25]</code>, and top-3 L1 have <code>[1, 0.666, 0.333]</code>3. Update the score by multiplying each score with the score of matching research fields at upper level, and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?0" title="0" /> otherwise. <!-- $$score(f_i^l) =            \begin{cases}            \prod _{l \in L} v(f^l) & \text{if field matched} \\            0 & \text{otherwise}            \end{cases}$$  --> <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=score(f_i^l)&space;=&space;\begin{cases}&space;\prod&space;_{l&space;\in&space;L}&space;v(f^l)&space;&&space;\text{if&space;field&space;matched}&space;\\&space;0&space;&&space;\text{otherwise}&space;\end{cases}" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?score(f_i^l)&space;=&space;\begin{cases}&space;\prod&space;_{l&space;\in&space;L}&space;v(f^l)&space;&&space;\text{if&space;field&space;matched}&space;\\&space;0&space;&&space;\text{otherwise}&space;\end{cases}" title="score(f_i^l) = \begin{cases} \prod _{l \in L} v(f^l) & \text{if field matched} \\ 0 & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}" /></a> where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?L" title="L" /> is the level of research field <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?f" title="f" /> and its upper levels. Here are examples of score update: - Soc-2-4 at rank-2 in L3, Soc-2 at rank-3 in L2, and Soc at rank-1 in L1. In this case, the score of Soc-2-4 is <code>0.8 * 0.5 * 1 = 0.4</code>. - Soc-2-4 at rank-1 in L3, Soc-2 at rank-2 in L2, but Soc is not found in top rank in L1. In this case, the score of Soc-2-4 is <code>0</code>.4. Collect score from L2 and L3, and exclude L2 if we see more specific of L2 in top-5 L3.5. Re-rank L2 and L3 research fields based on the score.6. Return research fields having score <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?>=&amp;space;0.4" title=“&gt;= 0.4” /&gt;.To expand to more context from paper list in bibliography section, we also build other three Naive Bayes classifiers for L1, L2, and L3 using paper title feature only. We believe that a publication from a certain field also cites other publications from same or similar fields. For each publication in the bibliography, we apply the same procedure as mentioned above, then we average the score to get top research fields from bibliography. Finally, we combine top research fields from paper titles and abstract with results from bibliography.### 5. Experiment ResultsWe discuss our experiment results for each task in this section. We use standard precision, recall, and F1 as evaluation metrics.<strong>Dataset Extraction.</strong> First, we analyze our experiment for dataset detection subtask comparing Naive Bayes and SVM classifier. Using only paper titles in bibliography and explicit research method mentions, Naive Bayes and SVM classifiers are able to reach 0.88 &amp; 0.92 F1 score respectively. Since SVM outperforms Naive Bayes, we use SVM for our dataset detection module. Table <a href="#user-content-tab_dd_dev_result">4</a> shows detail dataset detection results on development set.<a name="tab_dd_dev_result">Table 4</a>: Dataset Detection Results on Development SetClassifier | Prec. | Rec. | F1———- | —-: | —: | —:Naive Bayes | 0.85 | 0.92 | 0.88SVM | 0.96 | 0.88 | 0.92To see the impact of performing dataset detection, we test the performance of dataset extraction with and without dataset detection on development set. Table <a href="#user-content-tab_de_dev_result">5</a> summarizes the results. As shown in the table, performing dataset detection before extraction significantly improves the dataset extraction on development set.<a name="tab_de_dev_result">Table 5</a>: Dataset Extraction Results on Development SetMethod | Prec. | Rec. | F1—— | —-: | —: | —:No Dataset Detection | 0.18 | 0.33 | 0.24With Dataset Detection | 0.34 | 0.30 | 0.32<a name="tab_de_test_result">Table 6</a>: Dataset Extraction Result on Test SetDataset | Prec. | Rec. | F1——- | —-: | —: | —:Test Set (phase1) | 0.17 | 0.10 | 0.13Table <a href="#user-content-tab_de_test_result">6</a> shows dataset extraction performance on test set (phase 1). The significant drop from development set result suggests that the test set might have different distribution compare to the training and development set. It might also contain dataset citations that are never been seen in training set.<strong>Research Methods Identification.</strong> We only consider Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression classifiers for research method identification because they naturally outputs probability score. We perform 5-fold cross validation to evaluate classification performance, and the result can be seen in table <a href="#user-content-tab_rmethods_5cv">7</a>. Logistic regression classifier outperforms Naive Bayes with 0.86 F1 score in classifying 133 research methods.<a name="tab_rmethods_5cv">Table 7</a>: F1 Score for Research Method ClassificationClassifier | F1———- | —:Naive Bayes | 0.55Logistic Regression | 0.86<strong>Research Fields Identification.</strong> We perform 5-fold cross validation to evaluate our classifiers to classify L1, L2, and L3 research fields. Table <a href="#user-content-tab_rfields_pub_5cv">8</a> shows the results using n-gram features from paper title and abstract, whereas table <a href="#user-content-tab_rfields_rt_5cv">9</a> shows the results using n-gram features from title only. Naive Bayes tends to perform slightly better on L3 research fields where we have large number of research field labels. We decide to use SVM for research field identification on publication level because SVM is generally better than Naive Bayes. On the other hand, we decide to use Naive Bayes for research field identification on bibliography level because Naive Bayes prefer to have more accurate L2 and L3 research fields.<a name="tab_rfields_pub_5cv">Table 8</a>: F1 Score for Research Field Classification on Publication Level using Paper Title and AbstractClassifier | L1 | L2 | L3———- | —-: | —: | —:Naive Bayes | 0.78 | 0.37 | 0.13SVM | 0.82 | 0.38 | 0.12<a name="tab_rfields_rt_5cv">Table 9</a>: F1 Score for Research Field Classification on Bibliography Level using Paper Title OnlyClassifier | L1 | L2 | L3———- | —-: | —: | —:Naive Bayes | 0.80 | 0.35 | 0.12SVM | 0.81 | 0.35 | 0.11### 6. Lesson LearnedExtraction of research datasets, associated research methods and fields from social science publication is challenging, yet an important problem to organize social science publications. We have described our approach for the RCC challenge, and table <a href="#user-content-tab_summary">10</a> summarizes our approach. Beside publication content such as paper titles, abstract, full text, our approach also leverages on the information from bibliography. Furthermore, we also collect external information from SAGE Knowledge to get more information about research fields.<a name="tab_summary">Table 10</a>: Summary of Our ApproachMethod | Features (n-gram)—— | —————–<strong>Dataset extraction</strong> ||SVM for dataset detection | paper titles in bibliography and explicit research method mentionsImplicit entity linking | paper title and full text<strong>Research method identification</strong> ||Logistic regression | paper title, abstract, and full text<strong>Research field identification</strong> ||SVM (on paper) | paper title and abstractNaive Bayes (on bibliography) | paper titles in bibliographyApart from F1 score on 5-fold cross validation, we have no good way to evaluate research method and research field identification without ground truth label. Our methods are unable to automatically extract and recognize new datasets, research methods, and fields. An extension to automatically handle such cases using advance Natural Language Processing (NLP) approach is a promising direction.Our model did not perform well in test set, and unable to advance to the second phase. From this competition, we have learned that lacks of labelled training data is a huge challenge, and it directs us to other external resources (i.e., SAGE Knowledge) as proxy for our label. We are also interested in exploring more advanced information extraction approaches on the RCC datasets. Another challenge is data sparsity. Although we see many paper listed in bibliography, lacks of access to these publication make us difficult to exploit citation network.### 7.

Researchers have recently shown that datasets are becoming more important for science to function properly, even serving as artifacts of study themselves. However, citing datasets is not a common or standard practice in spite of recent efforts by data repositories and funding agencies. This greatly affects our ability to track their usage and importance. A potential solution to this problem is to automatically extract dataset mentions from scientific articles. In this work, we propose to achieve such extraction by using a neural network based on a BiLSTM-CRF architecture. Our method achieves <span class="math inline"><em>F</em><sub>1</sub> = 0.885</span> in social science articles released as part of the Rich Context Dataset. We discuss future improvements to the model and applications beyond social sciences.author:- ’Tong Zeng<span class="math inline"><em></em><sup>1, 2</sup></span> and Daniel Acuna<span class="math inline"><em></em><sup>1</sup></span>[^1]’bibliography:- ’rcc-06.bib’title: | Dataset mention extraction in scientific articles using a BiLSTM-CRF model—Introduction============Science is fundamentally an incremental discipline that depends onprevious scientist’s work. Datasets form an integral part of thisprocess and therefore should be shared and cited as any other scientificoutput. This ideal is far from reality: the credit that datasetscurrently receive does not correspond to their actual usage. One of theissues is that there is no standard for citing datasets, and even ifthey are cited, they are not properly tracked by major scientificindices. Interestingly, while datasets are still used and mentioned inarticles, we lack methods to extract such mentions and properlyreconstruct dataset citations. The Rich Context Competition challengeaims at closing this gap by inviting scientists to produce automateddataset mention and linkage detection algorithms. In this article, wedetail our proposal to solve the dataset mention step. Our approachattempts to provide a first approximation to better give credit and keeptrack of datasets and their usage.The problem of dataset extraction has been explored before.@ghavimiIdentifyingImprovingDataset2016 and@ghavimiSemiautomaticApproachDetecting2017 use a relatively simpletf-idf representation with cosine similarity for matching datasetidentification in social science articles. Their method consists of fourmajor steps: preparing a curated dictionary of typical mention phrases,detecting dataset references, and ranking matching datasets based oncosine similarity of tf-idf representations. This approach achieved arelatively high performance, with <span class="math inline"><em>F</em><sub>1</sub> = 0.84</span> for mention detection and<span class="math inline"><em>F</em><sub>1</sub> = 0.83</span>, for matching. <span class="citation" data-cites="singhalDataExtractMining2013">@singhalDataExtractMining2013</span> proposed amethod using normalized Google distance to screen whether a term is in adataset. However, this method relies on external services and is notcomputational efficient. They achieve a good <span class="math inline"><em>F</em><sub>1</sub> = 0.85</span> using Googlesearch and <span class="math inline"><em>F</em><sub>1</sub> = 0.75</span> using Bing. A somewhat similar project wasproposed by <span class="citation" data-cites="luDatasetSearchEngine2012">@luDatasetSearchEngine2012</span>. They built a dataset searchengine by solving the two challenges: identification of the dataset andassociation to a URL. They build a dataset of 1000 documents with theirURLs, containing 8922 words or abbreviations representing datasets. Theyalso build a web-based interface. This shows the importance of datasetmention extraction and how several groups have tried to tackle theproblem.In this article, we describe a method for extracting dataset mentionsbased on a deep recurrent neural network. In particular, we used aBidirectional Long short-term Memory (BiLSTM) sequence to sequence modelpaired with a Conditional Random Field (CRF) inference mechanism. Wetested our model on a novel dataset produced for the Rich ContextCompetition challenge. We achieve a relatively good performance of<span class="math inline"><em>F</em><sub>1</sub> = 0.885</span>. We discuss the limitations of our model.The dataset===========The Rich Context Dataset challenge was proposed by the New YorkUniversity’s Coleridge Initiative <span class="citation" data-cites="richtextcompetition">[@richtextcompetition]</span>. The challengecomprised several phases, and participants moved through the phasesdepending on their performance. We only analyze data of the first phase.This phase contained a list of datasets and a labeled corpus of around5K publications. Each publication was labeled indicating whether adataset was mentioned within it and which part of the text mentioned it.The challenge used the accuracy for measuring the performance of thecompetitors and also the quality of the code, documentation, andefficiency.We adopt the CoNLL 2003 format <span class="citation" data-cites="tjong2003introduction">[@tjong2003introduction]</span> to annotatewhether a token is a part of dataset mention. Concretely, B-DS denotes atoken that is the first token of a dataset mention, I-DS denotes a tokenthat is inside of dataset mention, and O denotes a token that is not apart of dataset mention. We then put each token and its correspondinglabels in one line and use a empty line as a separator betweensentences. Sentences were randomly split by 70%, 15%, 15% for trainingset, validation set and testing set, respectively.The Proposed Method===================Overall view of the architecture——————————–In this section, we propose a model for detecting mentions based on aBiLSTM-CRF architecture. At a high level, the model uses asequence-to-sequence recurrent neural network that produces theprobability of whether a token belongs to a dataset mention. The CRFlayer takes those probabilities and estimates the most likely sequencebased on constrains between label transitions (e.g.,mention–to–no-mention–to-mention has low probability). While this is astandard architecture for modeling sequence labeling, the application toour particular dataset and problem is new.We now describe in more detail the choices of word representation,hyper-parameters, and training parameters. A schematic view of the modelis in Fig [fig:NetworkArchitecture] and the components are as follows:1. Character embedding layer: treat a token as a sequence of characters and encode the characters by using a bidirectional LSTM to get a vector representation.2. Word embedding layer: mapping each token into fixed sized vector representation by using a pre-trained word vector.3. One BiLSTM layer: make use of Bidirectional LSTM network to capture the high level representation of the whole token sequence input.4. Dense layer: project the output of the previous layer to a low dimensional vector representation of the the distribution of labels.5. CRF layer: find the most likely sequence of labels.<img src="combined_images/bilistm_crf_network_structure_pic" alt="[fig:NetworkArchitecture]Network Architecture of BiLSTM-CRFnetwork" style="width:80.0%" />Character Embedding——————-Similar to the bag of words assumption, we can consider a token iscomposed by a bag of characters. In this layer, we convert each token toa sequence of characters, then feed the sequence into a bidirectionalLSTM network to get a fixed length representation of the token. Afterlearning the bidirectional LSTM network, we can solve theout-of-vocabulary problem for pre-trained word embeddings.Word Embedding————–The embedding is the first layer of our network and it is responsiblefor mapping the word from string into vectors of numbers as the inputfor other layers on top. For a given sentence <span class="math inline"><em>S</em></span>, we first convert itinto a sequence consisting of <span class="math inline"><em>n</em></span> tokens,<span class="math inline"><em>S</em> = {<em>c</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>c</em><sub>2</sub>, ⋯, <em>c</em><sub><em>n</em></sub>, }</span> . For each token <span class="math inline"><em>c</em><sub><em>i</em></sub></span>we lookup theembedding vector <span class="math inline"><em>x</em><sub><em>i</em></sub></span> from a word embedding matrix<span class="math inline"><em>M</em><sup><em>t</em><em>k</em><em>n</em></sup> ∈ ℝ<sup><em>d</em>|<em>V</em>|</sup></span>, where the <span class="math inline"><em>d</em></span> is the dimension of theembedding vector and the <span class="math inline"><em>V</em></span> is the Vocabulary of the tokens. In thispaper, the matrix <span class="math inline"><em>M</em><sup><em>t</em><em>k</em><em>n</em></sup></span> is initialized by pre-trained GloVe vectors<span class="citation" data-cites="pennington2014glove">[@pennington2014glove]</span>, but will be updated by learning from our corpus.LSTM—-Recurrent neural network (RNN) is a powerful tool to capture featuresfrom sequential data, such as temporal series, and text. RNN couldcapture long-distance dependency in theory but it suffers from thegradient exploding/vanishing problems <span class="citation" data-cites="pascanu2013difficulty">[@pascanu2013difficulty]</span>. The Longshort-term memory (LSTM) architecture was proposed by@hochreiter1997long and it is a variant of RNN which copes with thegradient problem. LSTM introduces several gates to control theproportion of information to forget from previous time steps and to passto the next time step. Formally, LSTM could be described by thefollowing equations:<br /><span class="math display"><em>i</em><sub><em>t</em></sub> = <em>σ</em>(<em>W</em><sub><em>i</em></sub><em>x</em><sub><em>t</em></sub> + <em>W</em><sub><em>i</em></sub><em>h</em><sub><em>t</em> − 1</sub> + <em>b</em><sub><em>i</em></sub>)</span><br /><br /><span class="math display"><em>f</em><sub><em>t</em></sub> = <em>σ</em>(<em>W</em><sub><em>f</em></sub><em>x</em><sub><em>t</em></sub> + <em>W</em><sub><em>f</em></sub><em>h</em><sub><em>t</em> − 1</sub> + <em>b</em><sub><em>f</em></sub>)</span><br /><br /><span class="math display"><em>g</em><sub><em>t</em></sub> = <em>t</em><em>a</em><em>n</em><em>h</em>(<em>W</em><sub><em>g</em></sub><em>x</em><sub><em>t</em></sub> + <em>W</em><sub><em>g</em></sub><em>h</em><sub><em>t</em> − 1</sub> + <em>b</em><sub><em>g</em></sub>)</span><br /><br /><span class="math display"><em>o</em><sub><em>t</em></sub> = <em>σ</em>(<em>W</em><sub><em>o</em></sub><em>x</em><sub><em>t</em></sub> + <em>W</em><sub><em>o</em></sub><em>h</em><sub><em>t</em> − 1</sub> + <em>b</em><sub><em>o</em></sub>)</span><br /><br /><span class="math display"><em>c</em><sub><em>t</em></sub> = <em>f</em><sub><em>t</em></sub>⨂<em>c</em><sub><em>t</em> − 1</sub> + <em>i</em><sub><em>t</em></sub>⨂<em>g</em><sub><em>t</em></sub></span><br /><br /><span class="math display"><em>h</em><sub><em>t</em></sub> = <em>o</em><sub><em>t</em></sub>⨂<em>t</em><em>a</em><em>n</em><em>h</em>(<em>c</em><sub><em>t</em></sub>)</span><br />where the <span class="math inline"><em>σ</em></span> is the sigmoid function, <span class="math inline">⨂</span> denotes the dotproduct, <span class="math inline"><em>b</em></span> is the bias, <span class="math inline"><em>W</em></span> is the parameters, <span class="math inline"><em>x</em><sub><em>t</em></sub></span> is the input attime <span class="math inline"><em>t</em></span>, <span class="math inline"><em>c</em><sub><em>t</em></sub></span> is the LSTM cell state at time <span class="math inline"><em>t</em></span> and <span class="math inline"><em>h</em><sub><em>t</em></sub></span> ishidden state at time <span class="math inline"><em>t</em></span>.

However, it is important to consider the information in theright context. A solution of this information need is bidirectional LSTM<span class="citation" data-cites="graves2013speech">[@graves2013speech]</span>. The idea of Bi-LSTM is to use LSTM layers and feedthe forward and backward flows separately, and then concatenate thehidden states of the two LSTM to modeling both the left and rightcontexts<br /><span class="math display">$$h_{t}=[\overrightarrow{h_{t}}\varoplus\overleftarrow{h_{t}}]$$</span><br />Finally, the outcomes of the states are taken by a Conditional RandomField (CRF) layer that takes into account the transition nature of thebeginning, intermediate, and ends of mentions.

We propose a relatively standard architecturebased on a BiLSTM-CRF recurrent neural network. We now describe theresults of this network on the dataset provided by the competition.For all of our results, we use <span class="math inline"><em>F</em><sub>1</sub></span> as the measure of choice. Thismeasure is the harmonic average of the precision and recall and it isthe standard measure used in sequence labeling tasks. This metric variesfrom 0 to 1, and the unit is the highest possible value. Our methodachieved a relatively high <span class="math inline"><em>F</em><sub>1</sub></span> of 0.885 for detecting mentions, inline with previous studies.

We are using the Adam optimizer with learningrate of 0.001 and batch size equal to 64. The hidden size of LSTM forcharacter and word embedding is 80 and 300, respectively. For theregularization methods to avoid over-fitting, we use L2 regularizationwith alpha set to 0.01, we also use dropout rate equal to 0.5. Wetrained 8 models with a combination of different GloVe vector size (50,100, 300 and 300) and dropout rate (0.0, 0.5). The performances arereported on the test dataset in Table [tab:Performance-of-proposed].The best model is trained by word vector size 100 and dropout rate 0.5with <span class="math inline"><em>F</em><sub>1</sub></span> score 0.885.We also found some limitations to the dataset. Firstly, we found thatmentions are nested (e.g. HRS, RAND HRS, RAND HRS DATA are linked to thesame dataset). The second issue most of the mentions have ambiguousrelationships to datasets. In particular, only 17,267 (16.99%) mentionsare linked to one dataset, 15,292 (15.04%) mentions are listed to twodatasets, and 12,624 (12.42%) are linked to three datasets. If thesedifficulties are not overcome, then the predictions from the linkageprocess will be noisy and therefore impossible to tell apart.Conclusion==========In this work, we report a high accuracy model for the problem ofdetecting dataset mentions. Because our method is based on a standardBiLSTM-CRF architecture, we expect that updating our model with recentdevelopments in neural networks would only benefit our results. We alsoprovide some evidence of how difficult we believe the linkage step ofthe challenge could be if the dataset noise are not lowered.One of the shortcomings of our approach is that the architecture islacking some modern features of RNN networks. In particular, recent workhas shown that attention mechanisms are important especially when thetask requires spatially distant information, such as this one. Thesebenefits could also translate to better linkage. We are exploring newarchitectures using self-attention and multiple-head attention. We hopeto explore these approaches in the near future.Our proposal, however, is surprisingly effective. Because we have barelymodified a general RNN architecture, we expect that our results willgeneralize relatively well either to the second phase of the challengeor even to other disciplines. We would emphasize, however, that thequality of the dataset has a great deal of room for improvement. Givenhow important this task is for the whole of science, we should try tostrive to improve the quality of these datasets so that techniques likethis one can be more broadly applied. The importance of dataset mentionand linkage therefore could be fully appreciated by the community.Acknowledgements {#acknowledgements .unnumbered}================Tong Zeng was funded by the China Scholarship Council #201706190067.Daniel E.

Forexample, each metadata source has their own approach for disambiguation(e.g. recognizing that A. Smith and Anna Smith are the same author) orde-duplication of content (clustering pre-prints and final versions intoa single record). As a result competition organizers and NLP researcherscurrently use ad-hoc processes to identify metadata and full textsources for their specific tasks which results in inconsistencies and alack of versioning of input data across competitions and projects.way these challenges can be addressed is by using a trustworthymetadata source like <a href="http://api.semanticscholar.org/corpus/"><span class="s2">Semantic Scholar’s opencorpus</span></a> developed by theAllen Institute for Artificial Intelligence (AI2) or <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/academic-services/graph/reference-data-schema"><span class="s2">Microsoft’sAcademicGraph</span></a>that make it easy to access standardized metadata from an openlyaccessible source. In addition, both Semantic Scholar and the MicrosoftAcademic Graph provide topics associated with papers which makes it easyto narrow down papers by domain. If full text is needed we recommendtying the metadata to a source of open access full text content like<a href="https://unpaywall.org/data-format"><span class="s2">Unpaywall</span></a> to ensure that thefull text can be freely redistributed and leveraged for modeldevelopment.gather the data we recommend collecting a sufficiently large set offull text papers (3,000-5,000 minimum) with their associated metadataand providing participants with a standardized format of the full text.More data might be required if data is split across many scientificdomains. For example for a task like dataset extraction, referenceformatting is often inconsistent across domains and dataset mentions canpotentially be found in different sections (e.g. background, methods,discussion, conclusion or the reference list) throughout the text. Oncea decision has been made on the full text to include, the PDF contentcan be easily converted into text in a standardized format using a PDFto text parser like <a href="https://github.com/allenai/spv2"><span class="s2">AI2’sScienceParse</span></a> (which handles keytasks like metadata, section heading and referencesextraction).the metadata and full text dataset has been created it can beeasily versioned and used again in future competitions. For example, ifupdated metadata is needed it’s easy to go back to the original metadatasource (for example by using Semantic Scholar’s<a href="http://api.semanticscholar.org/"><span class="s2">API</span></a>) to get the latestmetadata.[<strong>Annotation Protocols to Produce Training &amp; Evaluation Data[Alex]</strong>]{.s1}A common approach to machine learning known as <strong>supervised learning</strong>uses labelled, or annotated, data to train a model what to look for. Iflabelled data is not readily available, human annotators are frequentlyused to label, or code, a corpus of representative document samples asinput into such a model. Different labelling tasks may require differentlevels of subject domain knowledge or expertise. For example, coding adocument for different parts of speech (POS) will require a differentlevel of knowledge than coding a document for mentions of upregulationof genes. The simpler the labelling task, the easier it will be for thecoders to complete the task, and the more likely the annotations will beconsistent across multiple coders.Forexample, a task to identify a <em>mention of a dataset</em> in a document mightbe far easier than the task of identifying only the*mentions of<strong>datasets that were used in the analysis phase ofresearch<em>.order to scale the work of labelling, it is usually desirable todistribute the work amongst many people. Generic crowdsourcing platformssuch as Amazon’s Mechanical Turk can be used in some labellingexercises, as can more tailored services from companies such as TagWorksand Figure-Eight. Whether the labelling is done by one person orthousands, the consistency and quality of the annotations needs to beconsidered. We would like to build up a sufficiently large collection ofthese annotations and we want to ensure that they are of a high quality.How much data needs to be annotated depends on the task, but in general,the more labelled data that can be generated the more robust the modelwill be.mentioned above, we recommend 3000-5000 papers, but this begs thequestion of how diverse the subject domains are within this corpus.If the papers are all within from the financesector, then a resulting model might do well in identifying datasets infinance, but less well in the biomedical domain since the model was nottrained on biomedical papers. Conversely, if our 3000-5000 papers areevenly distributed across all domains, our model might be moregenerically applicable, but might do less well over all since it did notcontain enough individual domain-specific examples. a result, we recommend labelling 3000-5000 papers within a domain,but we plan to do so in a consistent manner across domains so that theannotations can be aggregated together. In this manner, as papers in newdomains are annotated, our models can be re-trained to expand into newdomains. In order to achieve this, we intend to publish an openannotation protocol and output format that can be used by the communityto create additional labelled datasets.Another factor in deciding the quantity is the fact that the annotationswill be used for two discrete purposes. The first is to </em>train* amachine learning model. This data will inform the model what datasetmentions look like, from which it will extract a set of features thatthe model will use and attempt to replicate. The second use of theannotations is to <em>evaluate</em> the model.Howwell a model performs against some content that it has never seenbefore. In order to achieve this, labelled data are typically splitrandomly into training and evaluation subsets.One way to evaluate how well your model performs is to measure the</strong>recall<strong> and </strong>precision<strong> of the model’s output, and in order to dothis we can compare the output to the labelled evaluation subset. Inother words, how well does our model perform against the humanannotations that it was not trained on and has never seen. Recall is thepercentage of right answers the model returned. For example, if theevaluation dataset contained 1000 mentions of a dataset, and the trainedmodel returned 800 of them, then the recall value would be .80.But what if the model returned everything as adataset, then it would get all 1000, plus a whole bunch of wronganswers. Obviously, the precision of the model is important too.Precision is the percentage of answers returned that were right. So,continuing the example above, if the model returned 888 answers, and 800of those were right, then the precision of the model would be ~.90.But again, if the model returned only one rightanswer and no wrong ones, the precision would be perfect. So, it isimportant to measure both precision and recall.In summary, the model in this example, got 80%of the right answers, and 90% of the answers it returned were right. Thetwo measures of recall and precision can be combined into an F1 score of ~.847. we then make modifications to our model, we can re-run it against theevaluation dataset and see how our F1 score changes. If the score goesup, then our new model performed better against this evaluation data. Ifwe want to compare several different models to see which one performedbest, we can calculate an F1 score for each of them. The one with thehighest F1 score has performed the best. Consequently, the quality ofthe annotations are critical for two reasons: first, the accuracy of a<em>model</em> will only be as good as the data upon which it was trained. Andsecondly, the accuracy of the <em>evaluation</em> (in this case the F1 score)can be affected by the quality of the data it is evaluated against. \—# Chapter 13 - The future of context# The Future of AI in Rich Context</strong>Paco Nathan<strong>The setting for Rich Context originated in needs to analyze confidential micro-data for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_for_Evidence-Based_Policymaking_Act">evidence-based policymaking</a>.The nature of that work involves collaboration using <a href="http://linkeddata.org/"><em>linked data</em></a>, with strict requirements for data privacy and security, plus provisions for data stewardship and dataset curation.Due to the highly regulated environments, that data cannot be examined outside of its specific use cases.In a world where public search engines crawl and index millions of terabytes, making search results available within milliseconds to anyone with a browser and an Internet connection, the setting for Rich Context may appear utterly alien.Seemingly, a reasonable compromise would be to run queries of sensistive data within their secure environments, and otherwise leave the process unexamined.However, there’s a broader scope to consider, far beyond the process of managing research projects or curating particular datasets.The great challenges of our time are human in nature – climate change, terrorism, overuse of natural resources, the nature of work, and so on – and these require robust social science to understand their causes and consequences.Effective use of data for social science research depends on understanding how datasets have been produced and how they’ve been used in previous works.That understanding of data provenance is complicated by the fact that research often must link datasets from different data producers, different agencies, different organizations.Other factors confound this situation.On the one hand, the availability of inexpensive computing resources, ubiquitous connected mobile devices, social networks with global reach, etc., implies that researchers can acquire large, rich datasets.Researchers can also fit statistical models that might have seemed intractably complex merely a decade ago.On the other hand, accumulating important information about datasets, their provenance, and their usage has historically been a manual process.Sharing this kind of information across organizations is difficult in general, and when datasets include confidential data about human subjects it becomes impossible to provide open access to the original data.These issues combine to contribute to a lack of reproducibility and replicability in the study of human behavior, and threaten the legitimacy and utility of social science research.The problems enumerated above make it difficult for people to understand about data usage, although at the same time they present opportunities for leveraging automation.Consider how one of the major challenges in social science research is search and discovery: the vast majority of data and research results cannot be easily discovered by other researchers.From one perspective, researchers are the users of micro data and its related <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata"><em>metadata</em></a> – in other words, information about the structure of datasets, their provenance, etc. – and those researchers produce outcomes, often in the form of publications.Publications accumulate expertise and nuances about datasets, including the data preparation required, research topics and methodology, what kinds of analyses were attempted and ultimately used, which information within the datasets was most valuable for the results obtained, and so on.These details produced through publications represent <em>metadata about datasets</em>.While the metadata within publications may be relatively unstructured – i.e., not explicitly articulated, nor shared outside of the current project – advances in machine learning provide means to extract metadata from unstructured sources.The exchange of metadata plays another important role.From the perspective of a data publisher (i.e., an agency) the many concerns about security and data privacy indicate use of <em>tiered access</em> for sensitive data.Datasets which do not contain sensitive data may be made freely available to the public as <a href="https://www.data.gov/"><em>open data</em></a>.Other datasets may require DUAs before researchers can access them.So the data sharing may need to be organized in tiers.Nonetheless, metadata for the private tiers in many cases may still be shared even though the data cannot be linked directly without explicit authorizations and stewardship.So metadata provides a role of exchanging information about sensitive data, in ways that can be accumulated across a broader scope than individual research projects.The opportunity at hand is to leverage machine learning advances to create feedback loops among the entities involved: researchers, datasets, data publishers, publications, and so on.A new generation of tooling for search and discovery could leverage that to augment researchers: informing them about what datasets are being used, in which research fields, the tools involved, as well as the methods used and findings from the research.## The Case for Rich ContextConsider the two most fundamental workflows within Rich Context, where analysts and other researchers interact among data providers, data stewards, training programs, security audits, etc.: - </strong>Collaboration and Workspace:<strong> where researchers collaborate within a secured environment, having obtained authorizations via NDAs (non-disclosure agreements), DUAs (data use authorizations), etc. - </strong>Data Stewardship:** where data stewards can review and determine whether to approve requests for using the datasets that they curate, and then monitor and report on subsequent usage.These components represent <em>explicitly</em> linked feedback loops among the researchers, projects, datasets, and data stewards.Researchers also use other <em>implicitly</em> linked feedback loops externally to draw from published social science research.Overall, the general category of linked data describes these interactions.A large body of AI applications leverages linked data.Related R&amp;D efforts have focused mostly on public search engines, e-commerce platforms, and research in life sciences – while in social science research the use of this technology is relatively uncharted territory.Also, given the security and compliance requirements involved with sensitive data, the process of leveraging linked data in social science research takes on nuanced considerations and compels novel solutions.This area of focus represents the core of Rich Context: the interconnection of point solutions that facilitate research, as explicit feedback loops, along with means to leverage the implicit feedback loops that draw from published research.Making use of AI applications to augment social science research is the goal of Rich Context work, and that interconnection of feedback loops, through a graph, creates a kind of <em>virtuous cycle</em> for metadata – analogous to the famous <a href="https://youtu.be/21EiKfQYZXc">virtuous cycle of data</a> required for AI applications in industry, as described Andrew Ng.In general, guidance for Rich Context can be drawn from the FAIR[^1] data principles for data management and data stewardship in science.The FAIR acronym stands for <em>Findable</em>, <em>Accessible</em>, <em>Interoperable</em>, and <em>Reusable</em> data, addressing the issue of reproducibility in scientific research.One observation from the original FAIR paper describes core tenets of Rich Context:&gt; Humans, however, are not the only critical stakeholders in the milieu of scientific data. Similar problems are encountered by the applications and computational agents that we task to undertake data retrieval and analysis on our behalf. These ‘computational stakeholders’ are increasingly relevant, and demand as much, or more, attention as their importance grows. One of the grand challenges of data-intensive science, therefore, is to improve knowledge discovery through assisting both humans, and their computational agents, in the discovery of, access to, and integration and analysis of, task-appropriate scientific data and other scholarly digital objects.In other words, throughout the use cases for scientific data there are substantial opportunities for human-in-the-loop AI approaches, where the people involved increasingly have their work augmented by automated means, while the automation involved increasingly gets improved by incorporating human expertise.One can use the metaphor of a <em>graph</em> to represent the linkages: those that span across distinct research projects, those that require cross-agency collaboration with sensitive data, and those that integrate workflows beyond the scope of specific tools.Specifically, this work entails the development of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_base"><em>knowledge graph</em></a> to represent metadata about datasets, researchers, projects, agencies, etc., – including the computational agents involved – as distinct entities connected through relations that model their linkage.<img src="combined_images/illo.2.png" title="example graph relations" alt="example graph relations" />Much of the intelligence in this kind of system is based on leveraging inference across the graph, insights which could not be inferred within the scope of a single research project or through the use of one particular tool.Over time, the process accumulates a richer context of relations into that graph while clarifying and leveraging the feedback loops among the entities within the graph.Rich Context establishes foundations for that work in social science research.The <a href="https://coleridgeinitiative.org/richcontextcompetition#problemdescription">Rich Context Competition</a> held during September 2018 through February 2019 invited AI research teams to compete in one aspect of Rich Context requirements.Several teams submitted solutions to automate the discovery of research datasets along with associated research methods and fields, as identified in social science research publications.Methods for machine learning and text analytics used by the four finalist teams provided complementary approaches, all focused on the problem of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_linking"><em>entity linking</em></a>, with a corpus of social science research papers used as their training data.The results of the competition provided metadata to describe links among datasets used in social science research. In other words, the outcome of the competition generated the basis for a moderately-sized knowledge graph.There are many publication sources to analyze, and the project will pursue that work as an ongoing process to extract the implied metadata.Meanwhile the increasing adoption and usage of the ADRF framework continues to accumulate metadata directly.## Use Cases for Rich ContextLooking at potential use cases for Rich Context more formally, we can identify needs for leveraging a knowledge graph about research datasets and related entities.For each of these needs, we can associate solutions based on open source software which have well-known use cases in industry.As an example, consider a dataset <em>A001</em> published by a data provider <em>XYZ Agency</em> where <em>Jane Smith</em> works as the data steward responsible for curating that dataset.Over time, multiple research projects describe the use of <em>A001</em> in their published results.Some researchers note, on the one hand, that particular columns in data tables within <em>A001</em> have some troubling data quality issues – inconsistent names and acronyms, identifiers that require transformations before they can be used to join with other datasets, and so on.On the other hand, the body of research related to <em>A001</em> illustrates how it gets joined frequently with another dataset <em>B023</em> to support analysis using a particular research method.The two datasets provide more benefits when used together.While access to the <em>A001</em> dataset gets managed through the <em>XYZ Agency</em> and its use of the ADRF framework, other datasets such as <em>B023</em> get used outside of that context.A knowledge graph is used to accumulate information about the datasets, research projects, the resulting published papers, etc., and applications for augmenting research derive quite directly from that graph.For example, feedback from researchers about how <em>A001</em> gets combined with other datasets outside of the <em>XYZ Agency</em> domain help guide <em>Jane Smith</em> to resolve some of the data quality issues.New columns get added with cleaner data for identifiers, which allows more effective linking.Other feedback based on machine learning models that have classified published papers then helps recommend research methods and candidate datasets to new analysts – and also to agencies that have adjacent needs, but did not previously have visibility into the datasets published by <em>XYZ Agency</em>.These are the kinds of applications that become enabled through Rich Context.Search and discovery is clearly a need, although other use cases can help improve the discovery process and enhance social science research.The following sections discuss specific use cases and their high-level requirements for the associated technologies.### Search and DiscoveryAs described above, the vast majority of social science data and research results cannot be easily discovered by other researchers.While public search engines based on keyword search have been popularized by e-commerce platforms such as Google and Bing, the more general problem of search and discovery can be understood best as a graph problem, and the needs in social science research are more formally understood as recommendations across a graph.For example, starting with a given dataset, who else has worked with that data?Which topics did they research?Which methods did they use?What were their results?In other words, starting from one entity in a knowledge graph, what other neighboring entities are linked?These kinds of capabilities may be implemented simply by users traversing directly through the links of the graph.However, at scale, that volume of information can become tedious and overwhelming.It’s generally more effective for user experience (UX) to have machine learning models summarize, then predict a set of the most likely paths through the graph from a particular starting point.One good approach for this is the general case of <em>link prediction</em>[^2]: given a researcher starting with a particular dataset and goals for topics or methods, represent that as a local, smaller graph.Then use link prediction to fill-in missing entities and relations, extending the local graph for that researcher.In other words, what other datasets should be joined, how can particular fields be used, what research topics or methods are related, which published papers might become foundations for this work?The most likely links inferred become top recommendations.Also, this kind of recommendation is not limited to the start of projects, it can be leveraged at almost any stage of research.### Entity LinkingThe Rich Context Competition demonstrated how entities and relations used to construct a knowledge graph can be mined from a corpus of scientific papers.Machine learning methods for <em>entity linking</em>[^3] used in the competition need to be generalized and extended, then used to analyze the ongoing stream of published social science research.This work provides potential benefits for the publishers, for example helping them analyze and annotate newly published papers, developing dashboards about data impact metrics for journals or authors, and so on.An additional benefit of entity linking is to help correct abbreviations, localized acronyms, or mistakes in linked data references.This is an iterative process which will need integration and feedback with data stewardship workflows.### ClassifiersAs any researcher or librarian knows well, curating a large set of research papers by hand is labor-intensive and prone to errors.Machine learning models based on <em>supervised learning</em> or <em>semi-supervised learning</em> (human-in-the-loop) can produce classifiers that annotate research papers automatically.At some point, the ADRF framework may run classifiers on the workflows (e.g., Jupyter notebooks) for projects in progress.By extension, classifiers may infer across the knowledge graph to add annotations for datasets as well.This work can be considered a subset of link prediction, also related to entity linking.### Transitive InferenceThe metadata collected through the use of the ADRF framework or extracted from research publications includes relations that link entities in the graph.Once a graph is constructed, additional relations may be inferred.This is a case of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transitive_relation"><em>transitive inference</em></a>, which can help add useful annotations to the graph, as shown in the following diagram:<img src="combined_images/illo.3.png" title="transitive relations" alt="transitive relations" />In an example from Norse mythology, Torunn is the daughter of Thor, and Thor is the son of Gaea, therefore Torun is the <em>granddaughter</em> of Gaea.The same process can apply, for example, to relations that describe links between datasets and researchers.Note that embeddings have proven to be a powerful approach for inference about patterns, based on deep learning.On the current forefront of AI research, methods that leverage <em>reinforcement learning</em>[^4] are positioned to outperform embeddings soon, since they explore/exploit the graph structure instead of relying on a history of observed patterns.This is especially useful for <em>knowledge graph completion</em>, where there are cases of incomplete metadata in the knowledge graph, which is essential for Rich Context work.### Iterative Improvement of the Knowledge GraphMost of the finalist teams in the Rich Context Competition made use of other existing graphs to bootstrap their machine learning development work, such as the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/academic-services/graph/reference-data-schema">Microsoft Academic Graph</a>, <a href="http://api.semanticscholar.org/corpus/">Semantic Scholar</a>, and others purpose-built for the competition.Those teams cited how some graph would need to be extended in the future, to improve recognition accuracy.Rich Context now subsumes that effort, making the iterative improvement of the knowledge graph an ongoing priority.In lieu of those other graphs used for bootstrap purposes during the competition, the Rich Context knowledge graph provides the foundation for machine learning.This process of accreting more entities into the graph and refining their relations leads to better training data and improved machine learning models.Over time, as our models improve, the previously analyzed research papers can be re-evaluated to extract richer results.That work in turn enhances social science research within the ADRF framework, along with data curation.That overall dynamic represents the virtuous cycle of metadata, which continually improves Rich Context.### Axioms for Dataset CurationAnother immediate use of Rich Context is to assist the data stewards to understand the broader scope of usage for the datasets that they curate.For example, ontology <em>axioms</em> used on the metadata in the graph can help analyze: - consistency checks for the incoming metadata - which data stewardship rules apply in a given caseIn a way, that helps codify what would otherwise be “institutional lore” – instead that’s now captured for others to study, use for training new staff, etc.Note that the ADRF framework must provide means for customizing and configuring these kinds of axioms, so that data stewardship rules rules are not tightly coupled with the security audits and release cycle.Those rules can change rapidly, depending on new legislation or other policy updates, or even due to different agency environments.## Leveraging Open Standards and Open SourceOverall, the Rich Context portion of the ARDF framework represents a <em>data catalog</em> along with associated <em>data governance</em> practices.As a first step in knowledge graph work, we can make use of existing open standards for metadata about data catalogs and datasets.For example, the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2013/data/">W3C Data Activity</a> coordinates a wide range of metadata standards, including:- <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat/">DCAT</a> – metadata about data catalogs- <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/void/#dataset">VoID</a> – metadata about datasets- <a href="http://dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dcmi-terms/">DCMI</a> – Dublin Core metadata terms- <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/swbp-skos-core-guide/">SKOS</a> – “simple knowledge organization system”These represent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled_vocabulary">controlled vocabularies</a> described in <a href="https://www.w3.org/OWL/">OWL</a> and based atop <a href="https://www.w3.org/RDF/">RDF</a>.These standards can be combined and extended to suit the needs of specific use cases, such as within the ADRF framework.In particular, the Rich Context knowledge graph is a superset of a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat/#conformance"><em>DCAT-compliant data catalog</em></a>.Taken together, localized extensions of these open standards represent an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology_(information_science)">ontology</a> – essentially as a specification for defining metadata that can be added into the knowledge graph and how that graph should be structured.Development of that ontology along with example metadata plus Python code to validate the graph is managed in the public repository <a href="https://github.com/Coleridge-Initiative/adrf-onto/wiki">adrf-onto</a> on GitHub.The workflows within the ADRF framework represent use cases of data governance, and there is substantial overlap between Rich Context and emerging trends for data governance in industry.There are open source projects which leverage knowledge graphs to collect metadata about datasets and their usage, where machine learning helps address the complexities[^5] of data governance in industry data science work.For instance:- <a href="https://eng.lyft.com/amundsen-lyfts-data-discovery-metadata-engine-62d27254fbb9">Amundsen</a> from Lyft- <a href="https://marquezproject.github.io/marquez/">Marquez</a> from WeWork- <a href="https://github.com/linkedin/WhereHows">WhereHows</a> from LinkedIn- <a href="https://eng.uber.com/databook/">Databook</a> from Uber (pending release as open source)Of course the Rich Context work addresses special considerations for sensitive data and compliance requirements.Even so, much can be learned from these related open source projects in industry, which are pursuing similar kinds of use cases.<a href="https://www.topquadrant.com/">TopQuadrant</a> and <a href="https://www.astrazeneca.com/">AstraZeneca</a> are examples of commercial vendors which construct knowledge graphs about datasets, also for data governance purposes – respectively in the Finance and Pharma business verticals.These commercial solutions similarly make use of DCAT, VoID, DMCI, SKOS, and also the FAIR data principles.In general, the subject of metadata exchange for data governance use cases is addressed by the <a href="https://www.odpi.org/">ODPi</a> open standard <a href="https://www.odpi.org/projects/egeria">Egeria</a> and related work by Mandy Chessell[^6], et al., including the <a href="https://atlas.apache.org/">Apache Atlas</a> open source project.Much of that work focuses on standards used to validate the exchange of metadata reliably across different frameworks.This implies potential opportunities for Rich Context to interoperate with other data governance solutions or related metadata services.To help establish open standards and open source implementations related to Rich Context, the ADRF team has collaborated with <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Project Jupyter</a>.A new Rich Context feature set is being added to <a href="https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">JupyterLab</a>, which is one of the key open source projects used in the architecture of the ADRF framework, and these new features will be integrated into its future releases.The new Rich Context features support projects as top-level entities, real-time collaboration and commenting, data registry, metadata handling, annotations, and usage tracking – as described in the Project Jupyter “press release” requests for comments: <a href="https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab-data-explorer/blob/master/press_release.md">data explorer</a>, <a href="https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab-metadata-service/blob/master/press_release.md">metadata explorer</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab-commenting/blob/master/press_release.md">commenting</a>.For example, a team of social science researchers working on a project could use the commenting feature in Jupyter to make an annotation about data quality issues encountered in a particular dataset.That comment, as metadata about the dataset, would get imported into the knowledge graph, and could later be used for recommendations to a data steward or other researchers.Note that most of the machine learning approaches referenced above are specific cases of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning"><em>deep learning</em></a>, based on layered structures of artificial neural networks. In particular, <em>graph embedding</em>[^7] is an approach that vectorizes portions of graphs to use as training data for deep learning models.Graph embedding can be used to perform entity linking, link prediction, etc.In many of these cases, the resulting machine learning models become proxies for the graph data, such that the entire knowledge graph data is not required in production use cases.That practice contrasts earlier and generally less effective approaches which relied on graph queries applied to the full data.Note that the <a href="https://ocean.sagepub.com/blog/an-interview-with-the-allen-institute-for-artificial-intelligence">winning team</a> in the Rich Context Competition was from <a href="https://allenai.org/">Allen AI</a> which is a leader in the field of using embedded models for natural language.Typical open source frameworks which are popular for deep learning research include <a href="https://pytorch.org/">PyTorch</a> (from Facebook) and the more recent <a href="https://ray.readthedocs.io/en/latest/distributed_training.html">Ray</a> (from UC Berkeley RISElab).## System Architecture OverviewThe following diagram illustrates a proposed system architecture for Rich Context as an additional module in the ADRF framework:<img src="combined_images/illo.4.png" title="Rich Context module" alt="Rich Context module" />Building on the DFCore features plus the Data Stewardship module, Rich Context provides both a destination for metadata (logging events from components, or extracted metadata from analysis of publications) and a source for metadata ontology used in the ADRF framework.Machine learning models get trained and updated based on the knowledge graph, then used for services (recommender system, classifiers, etc.) provided back into the ADRF framework, and additionally to support training initiatives – or for general purpose search and discovery by researchers.The additional system components for implementing Rich Context are based primarily on open source software (e.g., PyTorch) and extensions of open standards (e.g., W3C), all within the security context of AWS GovCloud implementation of the ADRF framework.## Trends, from origins to near-term future projectionsMeanwhile, the development of Rich Context has followed a familiar progression, echoing how the history of IT and data analytics practices matured over decades – albeit at a much faster pace.That progression indicates likely directions for how AI applications will come into use for Rich Context.Initial steps for Rich Context allowed researchers to analyze and report about sensistive data, while maintaining security and privacy compliance.That’s roughly analogous to data analytics during the heyday of <em>enterprise data warehouses</em> and <em>business intelligence</em> during the 1990s.Subsequent work improved online workflows for data stewards, adding reports about usage along with some metadata derived as “exhaust” from logs.That’s roughly analogous to “data driven” organizations that emerged during the late 2000s after initial adoption of <em>data science</em> practices.Next steps, such as the Rich Context Competition, began to use <em>machine learning models</em> to extract metadata that was embedded in unstructured data (i.e., research publication) to augment research efforts.That’s roughly analogous to the trends of machine learning adoption in industry during the mid 2010s.In the immediate future, Rich Context applications begin to leverage inference based on <em>knowledge graph</em> representations about researchers, datasets, publications, data stewards, and so on.Contemporary work in <em>deep learning</em> promises AI-based applications that can leverage embeddings in the graph, to give social science researchers better recommendations for their work.While that depends on historical patterns, current research on <em>reinforcement learning</em> to explore/exploit the structure of graphs can move beyond history and patterns, effectively considering “what if” scenarios that suggest unexplored research opportunities.That echoes the contemporary AI landscape, leading into the 2020s.## SummaryRich Context recognizes that social science research depends on <em>linked data</em> usage of micro data and its metadata.Effective management of that metadata is based on a graph that exists outside the context of component point solutions and specific workflows.While there is substantial use of linked data for ecommerce platforms and research in life sciences, social science research presents nuances and new challenges that haven’t been addressed previously.The Rich Context portions of the ADRF framework interconnect workflows that facilitate research – as explicit feedback loops in the graph – along with means to extract metadata from published research – as implicit feedback loops in the graph.That process creates a kind of virtuous cycle for metadata, making use of AI applications to augment social science research, with continual improvement of the entities and relations represented within the graph.A prerequisite was to create a corpus of research publications, used for training data during the Rich Context Competition, which demonstrated how to extract metadata from research publications.The next step will be a formal implementation of the knowledge graph, based primarily on extensions of open standards and use of open source software.That graph is represented as an extension of a DCAT-compliant data catalog. It will eventually incorporate the new Rich Context features going into Project Jupyter.Immediate goals are to augment search and discovery in social science research, plus additional use cases that help improve the knowledge graph and augment research through the ADRF framework.In the longer term, the process introduces human-in-the-loop AI into data curation, ultimately to reward researchers and data stewards whose work contributes additional information into the system.With this latter step, in the broader sense Rich Context helps establish a community focused on contributing code plus knowledge into the research process.## Notes[^1]: Wilkinson, M.
